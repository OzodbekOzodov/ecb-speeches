Duisenberg, at the press conference held in Frankfurt on 8/7/98. The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation. Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May. Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.</td>\n",

As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply (M3H) accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% in March. The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%. We shall monitor these developments very carefully. In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides a favourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation. It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued. In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects. First, any “growth dividend” resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debt levels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure.</td>\n",

Third, further structural adjustments in fiscal policy would also help to improve the policy mix in some countries and in the euro area as a whole from the start of Stage Three.

Duisenberg, at the press conference held in Frankfurt on 8/7/98. The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation. Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May. Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.   \n",

Duisenberg, at the press conference held in Frankfurt on 8/7/98. The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area. The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation. Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997. As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index (HICP) is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May. Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%. Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle. Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.</td>\n",

It is evident, however, that economic growth alone will not reduce the urgency to proceed with structural adjustments in order to tackle unacceptably high rates of unemployment. As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply (M3H) accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% in March. The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%. We shall monitor these developments very carefully. In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides a favourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation. It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued. In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects. First, any “growth dividend” resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debt levels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure.</td>\n",

The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&amp;E risks. The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&amp;E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the 2/4  BIS central bankers' speeches  \fbanks we supervise are exposed to these risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of their resilience on this front. The second of these initiatives is a comprehensive review of banks’ practices related to strategy, governance and risk management – the thematic review on C&amp;E risks, which is a key topic of the session today.</td>\n",

Since the crisis started, there has been important progress in labour market reforms and fiscal consolidation in euro area countries, particularly those under an EU/IMF programme. And the painful measures taken are starting to bear fruit. We see this very clearly, for instance, in the impressive improvement in export performance in Ireland, Spain and Portugal and in the recent uptick in industrial production in the latter two countries. The role of European policies and progress towards a banking union Let me turn now to my third and final theme. National policies alone are not enough to leave the crisis behind us once and for all. Policies at the European level are also necessary. For one, European measures to complete the single market, especially in the area of services, are needed. And I know that this is a need that is urgently felt in this country. However, major progress has been made in defining a vision and a path towards a genuine economic and monetary union. The banking union is a major element of this effort.</td>\n",

There is however no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central bank, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms, but whether they succeed in doing so. There are two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area, namely through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy and through raising its potential growth rate.</td>\n",

Banks are able to borrow liquidity from one another across borders, instead of having to resort to central bank funding. The common money market can also absorb larger disturbances than before. However, banks operating in the common wholesale system form a network, which could facilitate a rapid propagation of shocks across the euro area. A major problem at a key financial institution is likely immediately to be transmitted to other countries, through large and well-capitalised counterparties, or via the effects on liquidity and prices in securities markets. 2  BIS Review 91/2001  \fResponses by central banks and banking supervisors While responsibility for financial stability remains vested in the national authorities – even in the countries participating in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – the need for co-operation among national authorities has increased because of the concerns I have just mentioned.

Estimates suggest that the impact of this sizable increase on the non-financial private sector is relatively small, in particular for euro area households (see Figure 13, LHS). One reason lies in the interest rate fixation period of loans. Loans with floating rates or rates with rather short fixation periods are more widespread for euro area non-financial corporations. In contrast, the majority of newly demanded loans by households have longer interest rate fixation periods, making them more resilient against interest rate increases (see Figure 13, RHS). The estimates indicate that three years after the interest rate shock, the impact would represent a burden of 0.5% of household disposable income and about 2.5% of the gross revenues of non-financial firms, amounts that could be absorbed in the context of the ongoing recovery. 13 / 20  BIS central bankers' speeches  \fA sudden repricing in fixed income markets could lead to substantial capital losses for investors with large holdings of bonds.

The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&E risks. The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the 2/4  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

Since the crisis started, there has been important progress in labour market reforms and fiscal consolidation in euro area countries, particularly those under an EU/IMF programme. And the painful measures taken are starting to bear fruit. We see this very clearly, for instance, in the impressive improvement in export performance in Ireland, Spain and Portugal and in the recent uptick in industrial production in the latter two countries. The role of European policies and progress towards a banking union Let me turn now to my third and final theme. National policies alone are not enough to leave the crisis behind us once and for all. Policies at the European level are also necessary. For one, European measures to complete the single market, especially in the area of services, are needed. And I know that this is a need that is urgently felt in this country. However, major progress has been made in defining a vision and a path towards a genuine economic and monetary union. The banking union is a major element of this effort.   \n",

There is however no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central bank, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms, but whether they succeed in doing so. There are two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area, namely through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy and through raising its potential growth rate.   \n",
       "2072                                                 Market participants have generally expressed that they are satisfied with the way the market works. Banks are able to borrow liquidity from one another across borders, instead of having to resort to central bank funding. The common money market can also absorb larger disturbances than before. However, banks operating in the common wholesale system form a network, which could facilitate a rapid propagation of shocks across the euro area. A major problem at a key financial institution is likely immediately to be transmitted to other countries, through large and well-capitalised counterparties, or via the effects on liquidity and prices in securities markets. 2  BIS Review 91/2001  \n",
       "Responses by central banks and banking supervisors While responsibility for financial stability remains vested in the national authorities – even in the countries participating in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – the need for co-operation among national authorities has increased because of the concerns I have just mentioned. In fact, EU authorities have shown awareness that close co-operation is essential both for a strategy of risk reduction and for the prompt and effective management of any problematic events.   \n",

Estimates suggest that the impact of this sizable increase on the non-financial private sector is relatively small, in particular for euro area households (see Figure 13, LHS). One reason lies in the interest rate fixation period of loans. Loans with floating rates or rates with rather short fixation periods are more widespread for euro area non-financial corporations. In contrast, the majority of newly demanded loans by households have longer interest rate fixation periods, making them more resilient against interest rate increases (see Figure 13, RHS). The estimates indicate that three years after the interest rate shock, the impact would represent a burden of 0.5% of household disposable income and about 2.5% of the gross revenues of non-financial firms, amounts that could be absorbed in the context of the ongoing recovery. 13 / 20  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

       "this way, the Großmarkthalle will remain visible to its neighbours and those visiting the Ostend area. Let me now turn to the next steps to be taken in the construction of the new premises. As you know, we are currently carrying out the preliminary construction work, having received the required permit in February. In this context, the following work is currently being undertaken: •  Excavation work has begun for the basement of the office towers and the underground staff car park in the south of the site. •  The remaining ramp in the old railway delivery area and the two four-storey annex buildings at both ends of the Großmarkthalle are being removed. You may have noticed that the bricks that made up the external facade of the annex buildings are being removed by hand, one by one, since some of them will be reused for the renovation of the facade of the hall.   \n",

To preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy, and to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Governing Council decided in March to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III). They will start in September 2019 and end in March 2021. Significant monetary policy stimulus is thus being provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner. The benefits of our monetary policy measures have been sizeable and tangible.   \n",

The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team.

There is however no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central bank, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms, but whether they succeed in doing so. There are two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area, namely through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy and through raising its potential growth rate.</td>\n",

Estimates suggest that the impact of this sizable increase on the non-financial private sector is relatively small, in particular for euro area households (see Figure 13, LHS). One reason lies in the interest rate fixation period of loans. Loans with floating rates or rates with rather short fixation periods are more widespread for euro area non-financial corporations. In contrast, the majority of newly demanded loans by households have longer interest rate fixation periods, making them more resilient against interest rate increases (see Figure 13, RHS). The estimates indicate that three years after the interest rate shock, the impact would represent a burden of 0.5% of household disposable income and about 2.5% of the gross revenues of non-financial firms, amounts that could be absorbed in the context of the ongoing recovery. 13 / 20  BIS central bankers' speeches  \fA sudden repricing in fixed income markets could lead to substantial capital losses for investors with large holdings of bonds.

The 2022 SREP cycle will be marked by several key initiatives, which represent the next level of maturity for our supervision of C&E risks. The first of these initiatives was the climate risk stress test, launched in January and currently being conducted by a dedicated supervisory team. This stress test was designed, first and foremost, as a learning exercise – for supervisors, for banks, and for the financial industry as whole. We are adamant about the importance of raising awareness of C&E risks. And this stress test constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on our part, to understand more fully how far the 2/4  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

Since the crisis started, there has been important progress in labour market reforms and fiscal consolidation in euro area countries, particularly those under an EU/IMF programme. And the painful measures taken are starting to bear fruit. We see this very clearly, for instance, in the impressive improvement in export performance in Ireland, Spain and Portugal and in the recent uptick in industrial production in the latter two countries. The role of European policies and progress towards a banking union Let me turn now to my third and final theme. National policies alone are not enough to leave the crisis behind us once and for all. Policies at the European level are also necessary. For one, European measures to complete the single market, especially in the area of services, are needed. And I know that this is a need that is urgently felt in this country. However, major progress has been made in defining a vision and a path towards a genuine economic and monetary union. The banking union is a major element of this effort.   \n",

There is however no “one size fits all” model for how countries should go about tackling structural challenges. While there are principles that apply across countries, each economy is different and reforms have to be tailored to national conditions. As a central bank, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms, but whether they succeed in doing so. There are two main channels through which structural reforms can support long-run growth in the euro area, namely through increasing the adjustment capacity of the economy and through raising its potential growth rate.   \n",
       "2072                                                 Market participants have generally expressed that they are satisfied with the way the market works. Banks are able to borrow liquidity from one another across borders, instead of having to resort to central bank funding. The common money market can also absorb larger disturbances than before. However, banks operating in the common wholesale system form a network, which could facilitate a rapid propagation of shocks across the euro area. A major problem at a key financial institution is likely immediately to be transmitted to other countries, through large and well-capitalised counterparties, or via the effects on liquidity and prices in securities markets. 2  BIS Review 91/2001  \n",
       "Responses by central banks and banking supervisors While responsibility for financial stability remains vested in the national authorities – even in the countries participating in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – the need for co-operation among national authorities has increased because of the concerns I have just mentioned. In fact, EU authorities have shown awareness that close co-operation is essential both for a strategy of risk reduction and for the prompt and effective management of any problematic events.   \n",

Estimates suggest that the impact of this sizable increase on the non-financial private sector is relatively small, in particular for euro area households (see Figure 13, LHS). One reason lies in the interest rate fixation period of loans. Loans with floating rates or rates with rather short fixation periods are more widespread for euro area non-financial corporations. In contrast, the majority of newly demanded loans by households have longer interest rate fixation periods, making them more resilient against interest rate increases (see Figure 13, RHS). The estimates indicate that three years after the interest rate shock, the impact would represent a burden of 0.5% of household disposable income and about 2.5% of the gross revenues of non-financial firms, amounts that could be absorbed in the context of the ongoing recovery. 13 / 20  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

In this context, the following work is currently being undertaken: •  Excavation work has begun for the basement of the office towers and the underground staff car park in the south of the site. •  The remaining ramp in the old railway delivery area and the two four-storey annex buildings at both ends of the Großmarkthalle are being removed.

To preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy, and to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Governing Council decided in March to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III). They will start in September 2019 and end in March 2021. Significant monetary policy stimulus is thus being provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner.

       "      <td>Peter Praet: The TARGET2-Securities Framework Agreement Address by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the event marking the first signatures to the T2S Framework Agreement, Frankfurt am Main, 8 May 2012. *  *  *  Ladies and gentlemen, It is no exaggeration to say that today is a historic date for the T2S project. It marks the end of more than two years of negotiations on the T2S Framework Agreement, one of the most critical legal documents underlying the whole project. The President reminded us in his address of how important it is to cooperate if we want to achieve our Single Market objectives. T2S is a clear example of the very good cooperation amongst stakeholders in the post-trade industry: as of today, the spirit of the project will move on from negotiation to cooperation. We shall work together with the CSDs to implement T2S – for the benefit of the European financial markets. I would now like to congratulate the CSDs that signed the Framework Agreement today. They have demonstrated their willingness to adapt to change. They will play a central role until T2S goes live by preparing and conducting the testing of the system, and they will help us to ensure that the operations of T2S run smoothly from the beginning. This is especially true for those CSDs that will transfer their operations to T2S as part of the first migration waves. It is in acknowledgement of this contribution that those CSDs will be entitled to financial incentives reserved for the early joiners . I am delighted to welcome them to T2S. The CSDs that signed the Framework Agreement today represent about two-thirds of the total settlement volume in the euro area. In addition, several other CSDs are expected to join over the next few weeks, once their feasibility assessments are complete. In total, we expect to reach more than 90% – possibly 100% – of the euro settlement volume by June 2012. T2S is a truly European project, which is capable of generating great economies of scale and of bringing benefits to its users and to Europe as a whole. It is a network business: the larger the volumes settled in T2S, the more benefits for all of its participants, in terms of cost reduction and collateral savings. A large participation in T2S will also result in a wide harmonisation of practices and procedures across Europe – harmonisation, which will, in turn, bring significant efficiency gains for T2S participants. The close involvement of CSDs has been a crucial factor throughout the project so far, and it will become even more crucial from now on. I wish to join the President in congratulating those who have been involved in the project’s governance. T2S is an entirely new concept. It is unique and nothing comparable has ever been done before. From the inception to the go‐live, it will have required the engagement and collaboration of numerous different stakeholders, from the industry, from central banks and from other public authorities. Effective cooperation is key to the success of T2S. Decisions need to take into account several different points of view, while ensuring that the final outcome meets the objectives set in pursuit of deeper market integration in Europe. This complexity is the reason why we had to develop a specific governance structure to manage the project. Let me dedicate a few words to the governance bodies that have made the T2S Framework Agreement a reality: the T2S Programme Board and the CSD Contact Group. The T2S Programme Board has run the daily management of the project up to now, regularly reporting to the Governing Council of the ECB. I would like to thank the members of the T2S Programme Board for their dedication and commitment over the past three years. They  BIS central bankers’ speeches  1  \fhave coordinated effectively the several work streams constituting the project and fulfilled the mandate they were given by the Governing Council. They have made an enormous contribution to making the project a success. My gratitude also goes to the members of the CSD Contact Group, the main forum for the Framework Agreement negotiations, which has played an instrumental role in ensuring that a mutually satisfactory agreement could be reached. Following the signatures of the T2S Framework Agreement in June, the role of these two governance bodies will be assumed by their successor bodies: the T2S Board and the CSD Steering Group. In this new phase of cooperation, the T2S Board will concentrate on the implementation and testing of the T2S platform, and then on the CSD migration to the new settlement environment. The CSD Steering Group will articulate and coordinate the views of the participating CSDs within the T2S governance. A major change to the current setting is that the Chair of the CSD Steering Group will be a CSD representative. Together, the two groups will cooperate to make sure that T2S delivers on its promises. I trust they will continue the good work accomplished so far. I would also like to thank the T2S Advisory Group. In the next phase of the project, this group will retain its important function of ensuring that T2S delivers in line with market needs. The group has provided invaluable advice to the Programme Board and to the Governing Council over the past few years. The level of transparency on the T2S project through the Advisory Group has been – I believe – unprecedented. This has certainly been one of the key drivers of the project’s acceptance amongst CSDs, market participants and political authorities. Finally, I wish to thank the High Level Group T2S as well as the T2S teams both at the ECB and the 4CB. Their work is not always visible, but it is invaluable. Indeed it is thanks to their work “backstage” that the construction of the T2S platform is well on track. The system is now over halfway to delivery point and the development and testing of the application are proceeding on a firm footing. On this basis, and with the signature of the T2S contracts, we now have the solid foundations to continue building T2S and to transform post-trading in Europe, making it both more efficient and safer. We have taken a major step today towards making T2S happen. In years to come, we will see the Eurosystem, participating CSDs, and market participants more widely working together to make this project a success. Thank you very much.  2  BIS central bankers’ speeches</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: An ocean apart? Comparing transatlantic responses to the financial crisis Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Panel session “Taking stock: Global implications of transatlantic differences”, of the Conference organised by Bank of Italy, Bruegel and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Rome, 10-11 September 2009. *  *  *  This conference has examined in detail how policy authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have reacted to the financial crisis. I won’t consider in depth the events of the past two years. Let me just say that central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have responded swiftly and decisively, especially since September of last year, working very closely together, even to the point of coordinating some of their actions. Indeed, you doubtless remember that the first interest rate reduction in the easing cycle, on 8 October 2008, was a coordinated move by a number of major central banks. Market interest rates are now at very similar levels. For instance, the money market interest rates at the twelve-month horizon both in the US and the euro area are currently just below 1.3%. 1 Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have also resorted to a number of non-standard measures to provide additional support and stimulus to their respective economies. The choice and design of those measures reflects the structural characteristics of those economies. The non-standard measures implemented by the ECB have focused primarily on banks, as banks are the main source of funding in the euro area economy. In the US, however, market-based financing plays a more important role. The ECB’s framework for non-conventional measures comprises five main building blocks: meeting in full the banks’ liquidity requests at a fixed rate; expanding the list of assets eligible as collateral; lengthening the maturities of long-term refinancing operations; providing liquidity in foreign currencies; and, since July, supporting the financial market by making outright purchases of covered bonds. These measures are by now well known. We consider that they have achieved the desired objectives, in particular by reducing the spreads in the money market, flattening the yield curve over the short-term horizon and restarting the market for covered bonds – an important instrument through which banks finance themselves. So much for recent measures. Today, though, I’d like to look ahead and talk about a topic which has been widely discussed at recent international meetings: the exit strategy. This strategy sets a course for progressively reversing the policy measures that were implemented in recent months, i.e. the interest rate levels and non-standard instruments. Let me make it quite clear: this is not – yet – the time to implement the exit strategy. We clearly stated our view last week that the level of interest rate is appropriate, and we decided to conduct another one-year refinancing operation at the MRO rate (1%) with full allotment. But it’s critical to have a well thought-out exit strategy, because markets have to realise that the current policy is temporary and will be reversed when it is no longer appropriate, in particular when risks to price stability re-emerge and conditions in financial markets have improved. As far as the euro area is concerned, the primary goal of monetary policy remains  1  On Friday 4 September 2009, three, six and 12 month rates in the US (LIBOR) stood at 0.31%, 0.71% and 1.29%. The corresponding rates in the euro area (EURIBOR) were 0.80%, 1.07% and 1.28%.  BIS Review 107/2009  1  \fprice stability; and the ECB will do whatever is needed to carry out its mandate. Inflation expectations over the medium term have to remain well anchored. This is essential to ensure that long-term interest rates remain low, thereby supporting the economic recovery. Having an exit strategy is thus an act of responsibility for a central bank. Drawing up an exit strategy entails two questions above all: how? and when? I won’t touch upon the how – the instruments – as both Chairman Bernanke and President Trichet have examined this particular question recently. 2 Instead, I will address the issue of the when from an analytical point of view. The concrete implementation will depend on many imponderables, not least the prospects for economic recovery and for the stabilisation of financial markets – and those prospects are fraught with uncertainty. I intend to discuss a few issues that – in my view – central banks will have to consider when taking the decision to exit. This will show how complex and difficult that decision is going to be. My analysis does not pretend to be exhaustive, but in my view the following five issues demand our full attention. One issue is reversibility. Once the decision has been taken, we can’t easily go back on it. This seems pretty obvious, but it has some deeper implications. Let me explain. If the decision to exit is taken too late and monetary expansion continues for too long, fresh seeds of instability in the financial sector are sown. On the other hand, if the decision is taken too early, the economic recovery might be undermined. Mistakes in the timing, both premature and tardy, (what I would call type I and type II errors) have been made in the past. The solution is to do it right, obviously. Some might think that these errors are not so worrying because they can be remedied while the exit policy is being implemented. If the decision to exit has been taken too early, for instance, the central bank might slow things down. If, however, the decision has been taken too late, the exit can be speeded up. It sounds nice, but is a bit too easy. Why? Because the decision to exit is bound to have an impact on agents’ interest rate expectations throughout the whole yield curve, and lead to substantial portfolio reallocations. This is desirable, and inevitable, as the purpose of the exit strategy is indeed to change the behaviour of the private sector. But if the adjustment in expectations is large, it can lead to disruptions that affect financial stability and in turn jeopardise the sustainability of the whole exit strategy. In particular, any late exit which needs to be accelerated could produce unexpected shocks, for instance in the form of losses in the fixed income market which could hamper attempts by financial institutions to progressively regain access to the funding market. The effects of such a delay might lead to a prolongation of the non-standard measures which were supposed to be phased out. Remember the 1994 episode, when a mere 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate gave rise to major losses in the bond market (reflecting the fact that it was probably a bit too late). The losses then constrained the future moves, which had to be relatively more gradualistic. The second issue relates to the uncertainties surrounding the analytical framework that central banks have at their disposal in order to decide on the optimal interest rate path. Ideally, the stance of monetary policy should be calibrated in such a way as to avoid an implicit easing of monetary conditions as the economy recovers. This implies that the interest rate should be raised as the economy starts growing above its potential rate and as the output gap starts closing. The problem with this framework is that it is very difficult to  2  2  See the speech by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, “The ECB’s exit strategy”, Frankfurt, 4 September 2009, and testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., 21 July 2009.  BIS Review 107/2009  \festimate potential growth and the size of the output gap, especially after a shock like the one experienced over the last two years. Looking at the past, the major policy mistakes have been made as a result of overestimating potential growth and the size of the output gap, in particular during a recovery. This has led monetary policy to be overly activist and has delayed the tightening phase, thus fuelling financial instability. The two-pillar strategy of the ECB has helped to reduce this type of risk, as monetary and credit aggregates have been used as indicators of a strengthened economy, while inflationary pressures were still subdued. In the current phase, we might have to take into consideration the fact that the ongoing process of de-leveraging in the financial sector, which is likely to take place for some time as a result of the correction of the previous credit bubble, might affect the signalling content of money and credit aggregates. To be sure, the tightening phase cannot wait until inflation materialises, but will have to precede it. This is even more the case this time around, given the very low level to which interest rates have been reduced, and the distance from the steady state level that will need to be attained. The latter is in itself very difficult to determine, given the uncertainties about some of the longer-term developments in the economy. This will, as usual, present some communication challenges, such as having to answer the question commonly put to central bankers under these circumstances: “Why are you raising interest rates if there is no inflation?” The pace of the tightening will obviously depend on the underlying conditions, in particular the speed of the recovery. Given the uncertainties, it would be inappropriate to commit to any specific path ex ante. Another issue to take into account is the exit strategy from fiscal policy. I will not dwell on this issue, which is undoubtedly a challenging one per se. But there is a link with the exit from monetary policy and it will have to be considered. In particular, the more delayed the fiscal exit, ceteris paribus, the more the monetary policy exit might have to be brought forward. Indeed, given the level of the debt accumulated in most advanced economies, any delay in the fiscal exit is likely to have an effect on inflation expectations, and may even disanchor them. This is a risk that monetary policy cannot take, as it would undermine its overall strategy. On the subject of inflation expectations, allow me to digress briefly. Inflation expectations are an important indicator for central banks, as they reflect their credibility in achieving price stability. However, recent experience suggests that central banks should not be too complacent, even when expectations appear to be anchored, as the private sector might not always be a good predictor of future developments. Over the previous cycle, inflation expectations seemed to be well anchored, but partially concealed the build-up of asset market instability and longer-run threats to price stability. Well-anchored inflation expectations are a necessary condition for an appropriate monetary policy, but not a sufficient one. Let me touch on a final issue, related to financial stability. The exit strategy for the interest rate policy will be defined on the basis of the primary objective: price stability. In this respect, financial stability can only be a secondary objective. If it were given the same priority as price stability, the latter would obviously be compromised. The exit from the non-standard measures is likely to be linked to the state of the financial markets, and in this respect can partly be disconnected from the interest rate policy. Given the design of the non-standard instruments implemented by the ECB, the exit from those instruments can take place before or after the interest rate decision, without major effects on it. However, if at the time of the exit a number of financial institutions are still addicted to central bank liquidity, the transmission channel of monetary policy might be impaired. It is not the central bank’s task to continue providing liquidity to financial institutions which are not able to stand on their own feet, once the turmoil is over. It is the responsibility of the  BIS Review 107/2009  3  \fsupervisory authorities, and ultimately of Treasuries, to address the problems of these addicted banks as soon as possible, through recapitalisation and restructuring, as appropriate, and to ensure that all banks in their jurisdictions can stand on their own feet even without the central bank’s facilities. Let me conclude. I have tried to identify some of the issues which will have to be considered in implementing the exit strategy on both sides of the Atlantic. My observations have been purely analytical, and do not aim to provide any insight into specific monetary policy decisions over the next few months. My purpose was to explain parts of the analytical framework in which central banks will have to operate, on this and that side of the Atlantic. Just like the entry, the exit will also call for close interaction between the monetary authorities. This might not necessarily mean coordinated action or similar measures, given the different situations. However, the challenges ahead are quite similar. Ultimately, if we want to avoid “being too late” or “being too early”, the only solution is to “be right on time”. And this is what we are committed to doing.  4  BIS Review 107/2009</td>\n",

       "      <td>Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Monetary policy challenges in light of the current financial market developments Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at Alpbach Talks, Vienna, 15 June 2009. *  *  *  Introduction Ten years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was introduced as the common currency of 11 Member States of the European Union. Today, the euro is used by around 330 million citizens in 16 countries and it has established itself as a stable currency, accepted in financial markets worldwide. Looking at the inflation performance over the first decade of Monetary Union with inflation averaging slightly more than 2% during this period, the ECB has fulfilled its mandate under the Maastricht Treaty, which is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole. Nonetheless, undoubtfully, we are currently facing the biggest challenge so far: The world is hit by a severe economic and financial downturn, the deepest since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. It poses grave challenges to the financial industry and central bank community, as well as to supervisory and regulatory authorities and national governments and to the citizens at large. The key challenges arising from the current financial market turbulence Since August 2007 the global financial markets have experienced extensive corrective realignments. The repercussions of the turbulence were initially visible in the financial market in the form of dramatic increases in risk premia and increased volatility in interest rate movements. The outbreak of the financial market turbulence was not entirely unexpected, however. Both the ECB and other institutions had warned of macroeconomic imbalances and systematic undervaluation of risks in the years leading up to the crisis. Those years were characterised by an extended period of low interest rates, low inflation and sustained economic growth, both globally and within the euro area. At the same time, liquidity was abundant and default risks were considered by many to be very low. This environment strengthened investors’ risk appetite. In particular, with financial market participants expecting this environment to continue for quite some time, risks were systematically underestimated and the search for ever higher yields intensified. As a result, commercial banks readily granted credit for house purchases to households that otherwise could not have afforded it, and without adequately assessing their creditworthiness or credit default risk. At the same time, in an attempt to achieve higher yields, a number of innovative and increasingly complex financial products were offered, particularly in the United States. One prominent example of this was the bundling of mortgages in new and highly complex financial products and their resale as new securities to third parties via global financial markets. It eventually became evident that this practice was viable only as long as house prices in the United States continued to increase. When the many years of increases in house prices came to an end and house prices started to fall, problems soon emerged, including in the euro area, as banks here were among the buyers of these securities. Investors suddenly began to doubt the quality of their assets. This led to a sharp correction in prices on the financial markets, accompanied by a withdrawal of funds from the markets, leading to corresponding liquidity shortages for banks, particularly in the money market.  BIS Review 75/2009  1  \fResponse to the crisis From the very beginning of the crisis, the ECB has acted in a decisive manner. It has taken a number of measures unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. The ECB has provided large amounts of liquidity support to banks. By making changes to its operational framework, the ECB made sure that all solvent banks would have sufficient access to funding. When the crisis intensified in September last year, we introduced a number of new measures. Most importantly, we provided banks with unlimited access to liquidity at fixed rates for up to six months. The ECB also expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations. Moreover, we recently announced further measures, namely to provide longer term refinancing up to one year and to purchase covered bonds of up to EUR 60 bn. As a result of these new measures, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has expanded by a substantial EUR 600 billion and now stands at 16% of GDP, compared with 10% in mid-2007. The measures taken by the ECB have eased banks’ balance sheet constraints and thereby certainly helped to avoid a sudden collapse in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis. Moreover, in line with the substantial weakening of global demand and economic activity, inflationary pressures and risks have been diminishing. As a result, the ECB’s policy rates have been cut by 3.25 percentage points since the intensification of the crisis last October. These rate reductions, together with the liquidity management measures, have had a significant impact on money market interest rates. Since last October overnight money market rates have fallen even more steeply than the ECB’s policy rates. Money market rates in the euro area have now reached very low levels by international standards. Lower money market rates have also led to lower interest rates for private households and firms, although the decline in money market rates has so far been greater than the decline in interest rates on credit for households and firms. The fiscal authorities in the euro area have also demonstrated their capacity to react rapidly to exceptional circumstances. In a coordinated effort, the national governments of the euro area have provided support to the banking system, most notably through recapitalisation and guarantees for liabilities and assets. The funds provided under the package announced to stabilise the financial sector through these types of measure amount to 23% of the euro area’s GDP. The overall fiscal stimulus – through discretionary policy measures and the effect of automatic stabilisers – amounts to 3.6 percentage points of GDP for 2009 and 2010. Overall, during the ongoing financial market turbulence, the euro area and the EU as a whole have proved their capacity to act decisively and promptly under difficult circumstances. Lessons from the crisis The current financial crisis has pointed to a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed if we are to avoid a similar crisis in the future. Some weaknesses are rooted in the current design of the international financial system. This is particularly true with regard to the lack of transparency and accountability within the financial system. In this respect, much relies on financial players themselves taking responsibility for evaluating risk more effectively and increasing transparency as regards risk. In addition, various initiatives at national, European and international level aim, in particular, to improve the robustness of the financial system I would like to highlight three areas where I think change is necessary: there needs to be an increase in transparency, a dampening of pro-cyclicality and an improvement in institutional design in the field of financial supervision and regulation. First, we need to undergo global regulatory and supervisory repair. The Basel Committee has already set some milestones in this regard including the publication of the principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision and its current work on strengthening the  2  BIS Review 75/2009  \fBasel II capital framework. Work is also underway concerning the development of measures to mitigate pro-cyclicality stemming from the regulatory frameworks, namely by building buffers in good times that can be withdrawn in less benign conditions. In this context, let me recall that the G20 Leaders approved the recommendations by the FSB to address procyclicality, which are to be implemented by the end of this year. To this aim, the Basel Committee is developing proposals for countercyclical buffers and ways to promote provisioning over the cycle, with the aim to come up with concrete proposals by year-end. Second, regulatory gaps need to be closed. In that respect, the G20 Leaders endorsed last April the extension of the regulatory net to all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. These include systemically important hedge funds, credit rating agencies and Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives markets. With the aim of preventing regulatory arbitrage, the IMF together with the FSB, have been requested to develop, by autumn, guidelines to assess systemic importance. And third, macro-prudential supervision has to be strengthened. This includes in particular the global monitoring of systemic stability and the supervision of systemically important cross-border institutions, while properly addressing interlinkages among themselves, with other financial and non-financial institutions and markets. In this context, I fully support the broadened mandate and stronger institutional basis given to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G20 Leaders called on the re-established FSB to develop macro-prudential tools, together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to identify and take account of macro-prudential risks across the financial system and limit the build up of systemic risk for regulated entities. Moreover, the envisaged cooperation between the IMF and the FSB for the conduct of Early Warning Exercises will be crucial for the success of the global monitoring of systemic risks. At the European level, the proposal of the De Larosière group to establish a European Systemic Risk Council should substantially improve the assessment of risks to financial stability at the EU level. In order for the new Council to perform its tasks in an optimal manner – in my view – three requirements must be fulfilled. First, the ECB must have timely access to the relevant information, including information concerning individual institutions. Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action. And third, for the new Council to be independent and effective in its decision-making, it is essential that it have a solid institutional and legal basis. I also think the current crisis holds some lessons for monetary policy. The crisis has shown us that a stable financial system is a prerequisite for price stability. Monetary policy-makers should try to mitigate the risk of the build-up of financial bubbles by being aware of the effects their policy decisions can have on the financial system. Therefore, one could argue that asset prices should play a greater role in monetary policy considerations. As the build-up of an asset price bubble might have severe economic consequences in the longer term, central banks should try to deal with the bubble pre-emptively. Nonetheless, the interrelation of financial stability goes beyond the pure consideration of asset prices. Analysing developments in borrowing and lending, particularly loans to the private sector, is helpful in extracting the relevant signals from monetary developments on potential financial imbalances. Consideration of these aspects must become more extensive and systematic in the future. Strengthening the ECB’s role in financial supervision should contribute to ensuring that proper consideration is given to the possible build-up of financial imbalances when making monetary policy decisions. The current crisis has clearly demonstrated that risks to financial stability are accompanied by risks to price stability. Central banks must give even greater consideration to these risks in their analyses.  BIS Review 75/2009  3  \fThe benefits of the euro in the current crisis As mentioned, the current crisis represents the greatest challenge for the euro so far. 2009 will be a very difficult year. According to the most recent macroeconomic projections by ECB staff, published in June of this year, the euro area economy is expected to contract by between 4.1% and 5.1% in 2009. This means, among other things, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, less investment and less exports. That said, we should not forget how Europe would look today without the euro. In addition to the financial market turbulence, the problems in the financial sector and the economic downturn, we would be facing potentially large fluctuations between Europe’s national currencies. In fact, the currencies of some of the countries outside the euro area have experienced considerable fluctuations during the current crisis. This is an additional source of uncertainty for these countries. Therefore, the turmoil has confirmed one clear advantage of the euro, namely that, in stormy seas, it is better to be aboard a large ship than a small boat. This seems to be also reflected in the fact that many central and eastern European countries have expressed the wish to join the euro area as quickly as possible. This is no surprise, given that many countries have already made progress towards adopting the euro. Nevertheless, all countries must first fulfil all of the relevant criteria before joining the euro area. Still, I would like to emphasise that the euro area is not a closed shop. Five new countries have joined since the start of Monetary Union in January 1999, with Slovakia becoming the newest member of the euro area in January of this year. The door is open to all those that meet the clearly stated and predefined criteria for membership of the Economic and Monetary Union. Conclusion Joseph Schumpeter coined the expression of the creative destruction to bring about entrepreneurial innovation and progress. Schumpeter certainly did not have in mind an economic and financial crisis of the severity and extent we are experiencing today. But having the concept of Schumpeter in mind, the current crisis also created a window of opportunity for change and reform. This window, however, will not remain open forever. Therefore, we have to act now in bringing forward the necessary reforms in the international financial system to strengthen the supervisory architecture. The ECB stands ready to take up its part on macroprudential supervision.  4  BIS Review 75/2009</td>\n",

Introduction Thank you very much for the invitation to speak today to this distinguished audience at the Forecasters Club here in New York. Large parts of Europe are suffering from the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. An increasing number of sovereigns are facing financing problems. A solution needs to be found urgently. But fingers are pointing in different directions. In my view solving the current sovereign debt crisis is primarily in the hands of governments. Its root cause lies in lax fiscal policies and associated deteriorating public finances in some euro area countries. Stability criteria were violated, fiscal rules ignored and statistics tweaked. Growth dividends were not used for necessary consolidation in good times. In the same vein, competitiveness positions worsened in many euro area countries, due to a lack of structural reforms. These developments have raised doubts in financial markets on the political will and capacity to live up to their commitments and to do whatever is needed to comply with the rules of the game within a monetary union. To solve the crisis requires determined fiscal consolidation and ambitious structural reforms. These must be the prime answers for tackling current challenges. At the same time, it has to be recognised that sovereign debt issues are not confined to the euro area but have become an important issue for all advanced economies. Thus, I will focus my presentation today on the policy responses to the crisis and the requirements I see as essential in the areas of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms to cope with current challenges. Macroeconomic and monetary environment Let me start with briefly sketching the economic and financial developments in the euro area during the years of crisis up to now. Following the collapse of Lehman, financial market tensions escalated in 2008. As a consequence, we witnessed a severe global recession. After the deep recession that started in 2008, euro area real GDP started to contract and stood in the first half of 2009 about 5% below its level one year earlier, compared to a contraction of the US economy of close to 5% taking into account the recent revisions to US national account data. Continued strong external demand as well as a strengthening of domestic demand where the main drivers behind the subsequent economic recovery (slide 3). At present, it seems that some of the downside risks we had identified earlier have been materialising. Looking ahead, short-term indicators and survey data suggest that real GDP growth may be very moderate towards the end of this year and at the beginning of next year. Indeed, economic activity in the euro area is adversely affected by a moderation in the pace of global demand. In addition, the crisis continues to weigh on confidence and financing conditions in the euro area. These developments are expected to dampen activity. At the same time, activity should benefit from  BIS central bankers’ speeches  1  \fcontinued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, the continued extremely low levels of short-term interest rates and the various measures that have been implemented to support the functioning of the financial sector. Having said this, uncertainty remains very high and risks to the economic outlook on the downside. Turning to prices, average inflation in the euro area rose to 1.6% in 2010, and continued increasing in 2011. It stood at 3% in November, according the Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from previous months, still significantly lower than in the US. The main drivers behind the elevated inflation rates since the end of last year have been oil and other commodity price surges. As of late, increases in indirect taxes due to fiscal consolidation needs have been an additional driver. At the same time, domestic price pressures have remained moderate. Survey data up to October point to some easing in pipeline pressures, especially at the earlier stages of the pricing chain, i.e. producer prices for intermediate goods. In view of the rather weak growth prospects and continued slack in labour markets, labour cost pressures are likely to remain contained in the medium term. Looking ahead, euro area inflation rates are likely to decline in the coming months. They are expected to fall below 2% in the course of 2012. In the medium term, inflation rates should remain moderate. This is in line with latest available inflation forecasts from public sources. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations according to both survey and market based measures remain well anchored in line with the ECB’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. As to monetary and credit developments, following double digit growth rates in the build-up of the financial crisis, signalling risks for macroeconomic instabilities and price stability, annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 and in loans to the private sector fell sharply between 2008 and mid-2010 (slide 5). Since then, money and credit growth started to recover. However, underlying growth trends remained moderate, correcting a sizeable part of the excess liquidity that had been accumulated before the start of the crisis. Monetary policy The ECB from the very beginning of the crisis has taken decisive and swift action through both its standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. In a first response to intensified financial market tensions, and based on our assessment of medium-term risks to price stability in the euro area, we reduced our key interest rates by 325 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009 and kept them unchanged until April 2011. During this time, the main refinancing rate of the Eurosystem stood at 1%. (slide 6). Over the same period, the overnight money market interest rate (EONIA) also decreased rapidly, reaching levels as low as 0.3%. Earlier this year, in April and July, we raised interest rates in two steps, each time by 25 basis points. At that time, we were concerned that prevailing upward price pressures, mainly from energy and commodity prices, could translate into second-round effects in wage and price-setting and to broad-based inflationary pressure. However, the picture has changed since then. The economic outlook has worsened amidst continued high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. In such an environment, it is reasonable to expect moderate price, cost and wage pressure. This assessment has led us to the decision last month to reduce rates by 25 basis points. Our main refinancing rate therefore now stands at 1.25%, and the rates on the deposit facility and marginal lending facility at 0.75% and 1.75% respectively (slide 7). At the same time, we have introduced a number of non-standard monetary policy measures, with the aim to support credit flows from banks and thereby ensure that our interest rate is transmitted properly to households and firms. Notably, the design of these measures has taken into account the pivotal role of banks in financing the real economy of the euro area  2  BIS central bankers’ speeches  \f(slide 8). They focused on a proper functioning of the banking sector, by ensuring that funding markets, notably the money market, continued functioning. The main non-standard monetary policy measure in that context is the full allotment of liquidity demand by banks, at fixed, low rates, against eligible collateral. In addition, the ECB also engaged in buying government securities via its Securities Markets Programme (SMP). The Governing Council’s aim of this programme is to restore a proper transmission process that threatened to become impaired given dysfunctional market segments, as witnessed by very high interest rate spreads on sovereign bonds (slide 9). This is a major difference with quantitative easing in other major countries where such bond purchases are conducted in financing governments and against the background of official interest rates being close to the lower zero bound. The aim of quantitative easing is to have a more accommodative monetary policy stance via lowering long-term interest rates. By contrast, the ECB’s purchases of bonds aim to ensure that our official short-term interest rates are transmitted in a proper way to the economy. Another difference is that the ECB fully sterilises the liquidity injected in the market through its SMP while this is not the case in the US and the UK. The ECB has much less government securities on its balance sheet than the central banks of the US and the UK (slide 10). To be fair, this difference not only reflects the quantitative easing policy conducted in the UK and the US. In the US, for instance, government bonds already were an important item on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve before the crisis. The Federal Reserve typically implements its monetary policy through purchases and sales of government bonds. Let me also emphasise that all the non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the ECB are temporary in nature and complementary, rather than supplementary, to our interest rate instrument. At the same time, we should not forget the adverse side-effects of interest rates being kept at very low levels for a long time. In fact, the period preceding the start of the financial market tensions in August 2007 is reminiscent of the associated risks. Notably, the very low level of global interest rates after 2001 and the resulting ample liquidity conditions at the global level has laid the basis for the current crisis. In addition, maintaining very low interests rates for a protracted period may weaken the financial incentive for deleveraging for both the banking and non-financial sectors, and can result in “evergreening” of outstanding loans. Very low interest rates may also discourage banks from trading in interbank money markets. This is an important market for the transmission of monetary policy. Related, it has adverse effects on some financial institutions such as money market funds. Overall, the combination of standard and non-standard monetary policy measures has been successful in maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, while ensuring the transmission of monetary policy in difficult times. This is witnessed by fairly stable inflation expectations around ECB’s objective (slide 11). The ECB therefore has delivered fully on its mandate. Unfortunately, that cannot be said of all policymakers involved, resulting in the lingering of the sovereign debt crisis. To tackle the crisis decisively first and foremost requires tackling its root cause will require ambitious fiscal policies and structural reforms. Fiscal policy Let me now turn to the fiscal situation in the euro area in more detail. The severe imbalances that came to the forefront in the wake of the financial and economic crisis – to a significant extent – are related to past policy mistakes. In this context, one needs to bear in mind that the euro area neither constitutes a fully-fledged federation nor a political or fiscal union. While monetary policy is centralised, budgetary sovereignty remains to a large extent at the Member State level. The Stability and Growth Pact has been put in place to ensure a sufficient degree of fiscal coordination. However, this rules-based framework, which is built  BIS central bankers’ speeches  3  \fon peer-pressure, was not sufficient to ensure a smooth functioning of the monetary union. This calls for a more pronounced transfer of sovereignty to the European level and the move towards a fiscal union. Countries have joined the euro area and benefited from its advantages but some have failed to live up to the responsibilities that are inherent in being part of a monetary union. In particular, many euro area countries failed to achieve sufficiently sound fiscal positions in line with the rules of the European Fiscal Framework in previous economic good times. This was the consequence of a lax enforcement of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, notably due to a deficient governance framework at the European level. As a result, many countries already entered the crisis with weak fiscal positions which amplified the fiscal deterioration. In 2010, the aggregate fiscal balance of the euro area stood at more than 6% of GDP up from an almost balanced budget in 2000; euro area debt amounted to more than 85% of GDP in 2010. Moreover, 14 out of 17 euro area countries are currently facing an excessive deficit procedure related to a budgetary deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value of the Treaty. Particularly high deficits exist in the countries subject to EU/IMF programmes, i.e. in Ireland, Greece and Portugal, but also in some large euro area countries, notably Spain and France. As consequence, sizeable and persistent structural adjustment will be necessary in most euro area countries to put debt back on a declining path and reduce it to a sustainable level, in line with the 60% of GDP debt criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact. However, most advanced economies face substantial fiscal consolidation requirements. Notably, for the US, the IMF estimates that general government gross debt will reach 100% of GDP in 2011 and that it will continue to rise through the year 2016. At the same time, the general government deficit is expected to remain close to 10% of GDP in 2011 (slide 12). As you can see from the slide, significant aggregate structural adjustment of 1 percentagepoint of GDP per year will be necessary in the euro area to reduce the debt ratio to below 60% of GDP by 2030. For the US, even such a relatively ambitious adjustment path would keep the debt-to-GDP at around 75% of GDP by 2030. These scenarios highlight the significant fiscal challenges we are facing on both sides of the Atlantic in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. In European countries, the correction of excessive deficits is on its way. The pace of fiscal adjustment has been set by the European Council in a way that reflects country-specific imbalances. Most countries will have to reduce their deficit ratio to below 3% of GDP by 2013 at the latest. Accordingly, euro area Member States have presented medium-term consolidation strategies in their Stability Programmes which point to a strongly expenditurebased adjustment. Such an approach is warranted in view of strong increases in government spending during the crisis in most countries. Moreover, past experience suggests that successful consolidations typically have a strong expenditure component. In addition, case study evidence from previous consolidation episodes indicates that ambitious expenditure reform was typically carried out in the context of a broader economic reform programmes, comprising structural reforms to promote potential growth and institutional reform, e.g. to strengthen the budgetary framework. In fact, many euro area countries, notably the ones subject to EU/IMF programmes, are following such a strategy which I would like to call the European approach to fiscal adjustment. If effectively implemented, such reform programmes would enable countries to address their sustainability risks and, at the same time, limit potential short-term costs of fiscal tightening through growth-enhancing structural reform. Especially in the current environment of heightened market sensitivity, ambitious reform efforts should quickly trigger positive confidence effects and be conducive to macroeconomic stabilisation. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that European governments implement the announced fiscal consolidation and reform measures and ensure – by all means – the  4  BIS central bankers’ speeches  \fdelivery of agreed fiscal targets. This will be crucial to regain market confidence, notably in countries with very high and strongly rising debt ratios and pronounced risks related to the expected ageing-related fiscal burden. For these countries, with a view to ensuring a sufficiently swift return to sound and sustainable fiscal positions, it appears to be advisable to implement fiscal adjustment beyond what is required to correct excessive deficits and converge towards the medium-term budgetary objective, typically a balanced budget. Only if national governments strictly adhere to ambitious fiscal consolidation and reform does it make sense to seek ways to buy some time to implement the planned measures. The European Financial Stability Facility is the appropriate vehicle for that but before coming operational European governments need to deliver on their commitment to leverage funds available to this facility. Public programmes should be based on strong conditionality, as otherwise incentives to take the necessary national measures would be weakened. In addition, surveillance mechanisms at the European level need to be strengthened to monitor progress and avoid major derailments in the future. Decision-making in crisis times is different in our democratic systems. In the US, a mediumterm fiscal exit strategy has yet to be clearly specified. The bipartisan congressional committee on deficit reduction did not reach an agreement on measures to reduce the public deficit. At the same time, the recent downgrade of US long-term government debt and rising sovereign CDS spreads signal that no advanced economy is immune to a loss of market confidence in its public finances. It is therefore essential for the US to formulate a credible fiscal consolidation programme that returns its government debt to a declining path towards sustainable levels. Structural reforms As I mentioned before, deteriorating competitiveness positions in some euro area countries contributed to the current crisis. These countries therefore need to restore price and cost competitiveness. Apart from labour cost moderation, this calls for structural reforms targeted at removing remaining rigidities in labour and product markets, thereby raising potential economic growth. The measures should focus on enhancing wage flexibility and increasing competition in product markets, particularly in services. However, the need for structural reform does not stop with the euro area countries hit most by the sovereign debt crisis. For instance, the US economy would benefit from a more sustainable growth model, where solid and medium-term oriented economic policies strengthen potential growth and job creation. This would include structural reforms that address weaknesses in the labour market and in particular reduce long-term unemployment. Policies that stabilise the housing market, such as facilitating refinancing of mortgage debt, would also help households to deleverage and support private consumption in the medium term. Sustainable growth is also enhanced by policies that avoid the build-up of excessive misalignments in asset prices. At a global level, continuing imbalances require ongoing efforts to address factors or policies that foster disequilibrium flows around the globe. Enhancing exchange rate flexibility in emerging economies with large external surpluses would mitigate the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. Conclusion The lingering and expanding sovereign debt crisis must be halted to avoid macroeconomic and financial disaster, in the euro area and beyond. No country is immune anymore to a loss of market confidence in its public finances. With fiscal imbalances and deteriorating competitiveness in euro area countries at the root of the current crisis, there can in my view be no discussion which policymakers should make a move. Ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reforms by national governments in the euro area are required now – or actually, yesterday. Only if the course of national policies is the right one can an  BIS central bankers’ speeches  5  \faccompanying financing scheme as the EFSF play a useful role to bridge the period when market access remains restricted. Monetary policy in the euro area was and will remain an anchor of confidence and stability. It will remain dedicated to its mandate of maintaining price stability. This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy can make to fostering sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability. Monetary policy should not be overburdened.

       "      <td>Yves Mersch: Competitiveness of Europe and European financial markets Panel contribution by Mr Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 30th edition of the workshop \"The Outlook for the Economy and Finance\", Villa d'Este, Cernobbio, 6 April 2019. * * * To increase competitiveness is the main driver for higher potential growth. Member states have to pursue politics and establish institutions that stimulate the dynamics of a competitive private sector. In most euro area countries potential growth has remained too low, however. Labour market rigidities and inefficient business environment conditions seem to be major impediments. In particular, labour supply is held back by policies which do not sufficiently motivate to take up jobs and do not tackle skill mismatch or labour shortages. Moreover, investment could be strengthened through fostering competition, improve the business environment and reduce uncertainty e.g. through improving the quality and efficiency of public institutions more generally. Despite favourable economic and financing conditions, structural reform progress has been rather limited, including in several of the weakest countries. The trend of insufficient structural reform implementation observed in particular since 2014 has continued during the last year. Only a few countries have engaged in more far-reaching structural reforms, most notably Greece and France. Some countries even reversed recent reforms that had been designed to improve the smooth functioning of the economy, most notably in the areas of labour markets and pension systems. Overall, reform efforts were not in line with reform needs. These policy areas concern national competencies, but in a single markets cross-border spillover effects are generated. Governments therefore need to act at national levels, enhanced through procedures, rules and harmonization at EU level. Against the background of limited reform effort and in spite of the robust cyclical upswing, overall risks and vulnerabilities in many cases have only moderately declined since last year. The Commission’s annual assessment of country specific recommended reforms finds only limited progress.1 The progress made is evaluated using five categories: “no progress”, “limited progress”, “some progress”, “substantial progress” and “full implementation”. “No progress” means that the Member State concerned did not even “credibly announce” measures that would aim to address the policy recommendation. Out of 73 country specific recommendations (CSRs), none saw full implementation, and substantial progress was made in only two cases. For the overwhelming majority of CSRs (more than 90%), the Commission found that Member States made at best some or limited progress. On two CSRs, no progress was made. Most concerning, despite being very vulnerable, the countries experiencing excessive imbalances did not make significantly more reform progress during the last year than the EU average. The same is true for the countries experiencing imbalances. Overall, progress on reforms this year was as weak as last year.  The international role of the euro But also on the European level there is not only a role to harmonize national action in order to 1/3  BIS central bankers' speeches  \freap the benefits of the Single Market. Where competence has been transferred to the EU level, the need to spur competitiveness is at the EU level. The European Commission presented a set of action points to strengthen the euro’s global role. More recently, the COM has underscored the increasing relevance of capital markets union in supporting the international role of the euro amid geopolitical changes (e.g. Brexit and US foreign and trade policy). To this end, the euro should become even more compelling as a means of payment and a trustworthy investment currency. Without prejudice to the ECB’s independence, we took note of the Commission’s support for our initiatives on market infrastructure and payments, which help to increase efficiency and financial market integration in the euro area.  International trade It was important to resist, the temptation to gain competitive advantage or create national champions by tilting the system in one’s favour (e.g. in the area of tax, privacy, cyber security and fintech policies). The costs of fragmentation of global trade would be high. IMF staff simulations of a global trading system that had been fragmented into three trading blocs show that in such a scenario, each of the blocs was overall worse off, although individual countries within the bloc may actually gain. These issues would also apply to other areas like the international flow of data and access to the global payments system. There are five dimensions where progress is needed: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.  consensus on how to address social and economic grievances; a rethinking of the appropriate mix of domestic policies; strengthening and updating of the international rules of the game; adequate management of global public goods; securing the global financial safety net.  Payments systems The ECB’s responsibility for promoting the smooth operation of payment systems indirectly supports the international standing of the euro. The Eurosystem has contributed to reshaping and consolidating the infrastructure for large-value payments, for post-trading services for financial instruments and, most recently, for instant retail payments. Over the next two or three years we aim at taking measures to consolidate TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities (T2S ), in particular by delivering a centralised liquidity management function; developing a single collateral management system that will be capable of managing the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations for all euro area countries.  Harmonization agenda More harmonization is necessary to achieve a safe and efficient European post trade landscape. The European Post Trade Forum (EPTF) Report identifies barriers which have not yet been dismantled (formerly known as “Giovannini Barriers”), as well as new bottlenecks which need to be addressed to promote more efficient and resilient market infrastructures in the EU. These include: 2/3  BIS central bankers' speeches  \fInefficient withholding tax collection procedures Legal inconsistencies and uncertainties Fragmented corporate actions and general meeting processes More harmonisation of national insolvency rules is needed to make European resolution more effective. The recently agreed proposal (December 2018) is a minimum harmonization directive allowing member states to go further when transposing the rules into national law.  European issuance An important element in a well-functioning capital market is the smooth interplay between issuance on the primary market, investors and secondary markets. In Europe, the issuance and distribution of securities is still complex and operational cost are elevated. Securities are still issued along different national rules, standards and habits. Central Securities Depositories (CSD) play a pivotal role in this process. Today, issuers usually issue in one CSD. All other CSDs, and their national customer base, need to access these securities by connecting to this initial one. This chopped-up process is complex and relatively expensive. Investors and issuers alike see scope for improvements. 1 The progress made is evaluated using five categories: “no progress”, “limited progress”, “some progress”,  “substantial progress” and “full implementation”. “No progress” means that the Member State concerned did not even “credibly announce” measures that would aim to address the policy recommendation.  3/3  BIS central bankers' speeches</td>\n",

Inflation expectations, particularly at the three-year horizon, remained well below the perceived past inflation rate. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations and sharper declines than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)\\nIncome and consumption\\nConsumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to rise more slowly, by 1.1%, compared with 1.3% in March. The decline in expected nominal income growth was concentrated in the first four quintiles of the income distribution – consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile were on average unchanged. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable compared with March, at 7.0%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months reverted close to February’s value, falling to 3.8% in April from 4.1% in March. Developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending growth continued to be broadly aligned across age classes. (Income and consumption results)\\nLabour market and economic growth\\nEconomic growth expectations for the next 12 months were less negative in April, standing at -0.8% compared with -1.0% in March. In line with expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.2% in April, from 11.7% in March. Consumers expected the future unemployment rate to remain higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.0%), but the gap had narrowed to some extent. Quarterly data show that in April 2023 unemployed respondents reported their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months had fallen to 26.6%, from 28.1% in January 2023. Employed respondents reported that their expected probability of losing their job over the next three months had decreased to 7.8% in April, from 8.1% in January. (Labour market and economic growth results)\\nHousing and credit access\\nIn April consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.2% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported for two years – compared with 2.7% in March. The decline in expectations was broad-based across age and income classes. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged down to 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened compared with March, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months remained unchanged from March. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.4% in April from 13.6% in January 2023. This reflects a fall in new credit applications reported by younger respondents, which was partly compensated for by a rise in those reported by older respondents (aged above 34).

       "      <td>22 July 2022\\nHICP inflation expectations revised up across all horizons\\nReal GDP growth expectations revised down for the nearer term, but otherwise broadly stable\\nUnemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons\\nIn the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2022, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for all horizons. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, these stand at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% respectively, 1.3, 1.2 and 0.2 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions mainly reflect higher energy and food prices, but also the stronger than expected pass-through of input cost increases. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood at 2.2% on average, revised up by another 0.1 percentage point.\\nReal GDP growth expectations were revised down from the second quarter of 2022 onwards, as well as for 2023, but remained the same for 2024. Longer-term growth expectations were revised up marginally. Respondents noted that the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter of 2022 largely offset the weaker dynamics expected for the other quarters. They report that the main factors contributing to this bleaker growth outlook include intensifying energy price pressures, the tightening of monetary policy around the world and the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of households. They noted that although the supply chain bottlenecks linked to the COVID-19 crisis have eased somewhat, they are still acting as a drag on the global economy. By contrast, fiscal measures against rising energy prices have cushioned the energy price shock to some extent, and the effects of the reopening of the economy have also played out positively.\\nNotwithstanding the downward revisions to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were again revised down for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.7% in 2022 to 6.4% by 2027. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level in the history of the ECB SPF, which started in 1999.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jean-Claude Trichet: Lessons from the crisis and steps towards economic stability Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), at the 9th Munich Economic Summit, Munich, 29 April 2010. *  *  *  Sehr geehrter Herr Bundespräsident, lieber Horst Köhler, Sehr geehrter Herr Chrobog, sehr geehrter Professor Sinn, Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, ich danke den Veranstaltern dieser Konferenz recht herzlich für die Einladung. Besonders dankbar bin ich für die Gelegenheit, im Anschluss an meinen langjährigen Freund Horst Köhler sprechen zu dürfen. Wir sind uns über einen langen Zeitraum hinweg in verschiedenen Positionen immer wieder begegnet und haben oft sehr eng zusammengearbeitet. It has always been an enormous pleasure to talk with him and to work with him. Both of us were engaged in the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty. That is where we met nearly twenty years ago. We were also heavily involved with the handling of the European Monetary System crisis in 1992/93. I remember that episode very well. It was a defining moment not only for the monetary integration of Europe. It remains in our memories as a vivid example of what close and friendly cooperation can do in very exceptional and demanding circumstances. In my remarks today I would first like to reflect on the lessons that I believe we can draw from today’s financial and economic crisis. In the second part, I will touch on the current situation, and describe the three key steps that I believe we need to take to return to the path of economic stability. Lessons of the financial crisis The financial crisis has taught us painful lessons. It has revealed fundamental weaknesses in our global financial system. In the years that led up to the crisis, the European Central Bank was among those institutions that warned against the under-pricing of risk in financial markets. But the growing complexity of the global financial system and specifically its international linkages made it difficult to predict how and when developments would turn. With hindsight we know a great deal about the causes of the crisis. Financial innovation led to the development of new instruments that were intended to expand the diversification of risk for savers and investors. In retrospect, we know that instead they contributed to a common exposure to systemic risk. Gradually, the focus of finance shifted in the recent past. From its traditional role of helping the real economy to cope with economic risk, finance became a self-referential activity. The notion of “financial engineering” is a striking illustration of the shift of attitudes that spearheaded the changing focus of finance. When I started my professional career, no one would have used this expression. Engineering is about building tangible structures that support human endeavours. Some of the structures that were invented in finance turned out to be neither tangible nor helpful to society. Nevertheless, the vast expansion of the financial sector would not have been possible without both supportive macroeconomic conditions and inadequate prudential regulation. Global current account imbalances have generated large financial flows, as large developed countries sucked in massive capital flows from oil exporting and emerging economies.  BIS Review 59/2010  1  \fSeemingly bright macroeconomic prospects combined with deregulation and global conditions of over-extended credit. The crisis has shown that deregulation does not always pave the way for greater efficiency and greater prosperity. Rather we have rediscovered the value of properly functioning regulatory and supervisory institutions. And we have also rediscovered the value of mediumterm orientation, sustainability and stability. Consequences of the financial crisis The consequences to be drawn to minimise the risk of a comparable crisis in the future are numerous and wide-ranging. First, comprehensive regulatory reforms of the financial system have to be implemented with top priority. While some progress has been already made, major challenges lie ahead. Most importantly, the pro-cyclicality of the financial system must be mitigated. It is essential to change regulatory and accounting rules that tend to amplify the natural cyclical swings of our economies. Second, we have to enhance the transparency of financial structures. That concerns rules of disclosure as well as market infrastructure. In particular, derivative market instruments need to be subject to greater transparency. But, beyond changes in financial governance, there needs to be a deeper economic assessment of the benefits of these structures to society. Third, incentives should be aligned. Remuneration schemes, for example, should support sustainable business rather than myopic trading. There is one over-arching issue that I would like to highlight: the financial industry has to reconsider its role in the economy. Returning to a role of serving the real economy would be desirable. “Financial engineers” may prefer to create ever more “sophisticated” financial products. But finance has to come back to the basics. Among the basic tasks of the financial industry is the supply of credit to the real economy. This too is a profitable business, the profits from which are justified because they are mirrored by the social value of the intermediation function. Businesses and individuals depend in particular on the steady supply of credit by banks. The ECB and the national central banks of the euro area have taken comprehensive measures during the crisis to help commercial banks and other financial institutions. When the turbulence started in August 2007, the ECB was the first central bank to step in by frontloading liquidity. After the intensification of the crisis in the autumn of 2008, we tackled the paralysis of interbank transactions in the money market. In addition to a swift and substantial reduction of our policy rate, in line with our primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, we decided to implement a set of non-standard measures, which we collectively refer to as “enhanced credit support”. I explained these measures in detail here in Munich in a speech last July. These measures have significantly helped to maintain banks’ liquidity. But we did not pursue this policy with the ultimate goal of reconstructing banks’ profitability. Rather, the purpose of our enhanced credit support has been to ensure the transmission of monetary policy transactions to the broader economy. Global economic governance The crisis has important implications for economic governance, and here remarkable efforts have been made or are under way. On the global level, the G20 has become the main forum for international cooperation, and a strong consensus has emerged within this group not only  2  BIS Review 59/2010  \fabout the causes of the crisis but also about the appropriate policy responses. The G20 has been highly effective in addressing the global crisis. The more technical questions concerning regulation and financial stability are mainly delegated to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The extension of both the membership and the range of tasks of the previous Financial Stability Forum have pushed the Financial Stability Board into a leading role when it comes to coordinating the reform of financial regulation. The European regulatory response to the crisis will include a new body that will provide macroprudential oversight and focus on the avoidance of systemic risk in the financial system of the European Union as a whole. This is the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the establishment of which intends to make macro-prudential oversight operational at the European level. While the ECB and the national central banks of the European Union will be heavily involved in the ESRB framework, it is essential to make a clear separation between macro-prudential oversight and monetary policy. The primary objective of euro area monetary policy will remain the maintenance of price stability. Financial stability lays the conditions for the central bank to pursue its task of maintaining stable prices. It is also the outcome of an environment of steady macroeconomic prospects and confidence, which only stable prices can ensure. Current challenges for European integration Ladies and gentlemen, although the financial crisis did not originate here, it has profoundly challenged the European economy – and it is continuing to do so. Economic and Monetary Union – in short: EMU – is a union based on two foundations: economic and monetary. These are two foundations that reinforce one another. Responsibility for the “M” is centralised and assigned to the Eurosystem with the ECB at its core, aiming to ensure price stability in the euro area over the medium term. We have defined price stability as an average annual inflation rate below but close to 2% over the medium term. How have we performed against this objective since the introduction of the euro? Based on current staff projections for this year, by the end of 2010, the average inflation rate in the euro area since the introduction of the euro is estimated to be around 1.95%. Beyond the ups and downs of the economic cycle since 1999, despite the swings in the international prices of raw materials, monetary policy has managed to keep its inflation record faithful to its strategic aim. I am satisfied that we have fulfilled our mandate. Speaking in Germany, I would like to recall that the average annual inflation rate in this country in the 1990s was 2.2%, and in the 1980s it was 2.9%. Given the initial promise made to all people of Europe that the euro would be as credible, reliable and as good a store of value as were the best of the national currencies. On these figures, I can say that with an estimated average annual inflation rate of 1.95% for the first twelve years, the euro is in terms of safeguarding purchasing power “stark wie die D-Mark”. In a nutshell, the “M” has done its part. The main current challenges for our union originate in the “E”. Economic union is based on responsible national policies: fiscal policies, wage policies, structural policies. At the core of the economic union is the Stability and Growth Pact. The crisis has revealed some of the shortcomings of national policies to comply with the requirements of an economic union. In particular, in a number of cases, national policies that  BIS Review 59/2010  3  \fare responsible for domestic public finances and for the competitiveness of member economies have not achieved their objectives. But the crisis has also revealed weaknesses in the peer surveillance process and in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Thus another major lesson of the crisis is the need to strengthen the institutional framework of the economic union. Of course, the deterioration of public budgets has partly been due to a “migration” of risk from the financial sector to the public sector. Public budgets have been called on to absorb the excessive risk that the financial industry had been creating during the booming years that led up to the crisis. Partly, however, the deterioration of public budgets is also due to some short-sighted fiscal and economic decisions in the brighter times that preceded the crisis. Before the crisis, weak public finances had combined in some countries with inattention to domestic competitiveness and a lack of long-term strategies to prepare national economies for competing successfully in the challenging – but rewarding – environment of the internal market. In Greece, in particular, past fiscal irresponsibility and inattentiveness to domestic competitiveness made the national economy extraordinarily vulnerable to a sudden turn in confidence. As I have implied, after the crisis, the main players in the world economy will be judged by a new yardstick. Private players will be held accountable to new and stricter standards of economic integrity and prudent management. And governments, the world over – and in Europe in particular – will have to show self-discipline and trustworthiness to gain respect and preserve confidence. That is why financial reform will have to go hand in hand with fiscal reform. Fiscal reform will reinforce confidence. In the current situation, we have to – and we do – stand firm on these principles. Speculation on more and more elevated sovereign risk has been one factor behind spreads being driven to very high levels. This is why it was very important that the heads of state and government declared on 11 February 2010 that they were ready to “take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole”. I said, on behalf of the ECB, that I approved of this important statement. In this respect let me stress the following: Loans are not transfers, and loans come at a cost. They come not only at a financial cost; they also come with a strict conditionality. This conditionality needs to give assurance to lenders, not only that they will be repaid but also that the borrower will be able to stand on its own feet over a multi-year horizon. In the case of Greece, this will require courageous, recognisable and specific actions by the Greek government that will lastingly and credibly consolidate the public budget. Other countries in the Union and elsewhere have gone through times that were no less difficult, and they have emerged from a determined adjustment stronger and more competitive than in the past. These countries have demonstrated that a clear U-turn in national policy governance is achievable. After making the turn, they have reaped large payoffs. I will not comment on the negotiations that are currently taking place in Athens. They have to be concluded by a courageous, comprehensive and convincing multi-year programme. And I am confident as regards the results of these discussions between the Greek government, the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Let me add a word about Germany and the current public debate here. I very much appreciated the invitation by Finance Minister Schäuble yesterday to speak with the floor leaders of all political parties represented in the Bundestag. I said yesterday in Berlin that I had found this meeting – in which Jürgen Stark and I could respond to all questions of our  4  BIS Review 59/2010  \finterlocutors – extremely important. My main message was that a fast parliamentary procedure was highly recommended in the present circumstances. What we need most at this time is a strong sense of direction. We need a sense of direction that can guide us on how we can emerge from these turbulent events and how we can return to the path of economic stability. In my view, this sense of direction can be provided in three steps: first, in the case of Greece, a strong and credible programme, negotiated between the Commission, the ECB, IMF and the Greek government. Second, the support I have mentioned that will avoid the materialisation of financial risks for the euro area as a whole. And third, a giant step forward in our own framework of surveillance, peer pressure and policy adjustment within the monetary union. Speaking in the presence of Federal President Köhler, who played such a decisive role in creating monetary union and in the presence of the former Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the father of the Stability and Growth Pact, I must say that I count on the contribution of Germany with regard to the third step – the leap forward in policy surveillance and policy adjustment. Fiscal adjustment alone will not be sufficient to ensure sustainability. Structural reforms that will lead to more balanced growth are also vital to rebuild the resilience of our economies. The result must therefore be a renewal of the Stability and Growth Pact and the incorporation of a framework of surveillance for national policies of competitiveness. I hope that considerable energy will be devoted to this area in this country, so that a central outcome of the present demanding episode will be to strengthen the foundations of our monetary union. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has reacted with speed, energy and determination in the financial crisis. We have to stay on this path. We continue to need wise and sound, rapid and determined action by all countries. We need to resolutely improve the effectiveness of the peers’ surveillance of fiscal and economic policies. The weak points of past multilateral surveillance will be corrected, and the Stability and Growth Pact will be reinforced and rigorously applied in its letter and in its spirit. It has to spot at an early stage and to correct deviant behaviours. The overall scope of peers’ surveillance should be resolutely broadened to include the competitiveness as well as structural reforms of individual countries, so as to maintain healthy and sustainable growth as the ECB has constantly asked for during the past year. In doing so we will pave the way for a European economy which will have a higher level of growth potential, and which will be prosperous, stable and resilient. The introduction of the single currency represents the greatest achievement to date in the history of European integration – a process that has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe. Countries that share a common currency share a common destiny. Thank you for your attention.  BIS Review 59/2010  5</td>\n",

       "      <td>Jean-Claude Trichet: Reflections on the global financial system Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the 2007 25th Anniversary IIF Annual Membership Meeting, Washington DC, 20 October 2007. * I.  *  *  Introduction  It is a great pleasure to be here on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary IIF Annual Membership Meeting. During the last quarter of a century, the Institute has proved to be both an important coordination forum for the international financial industry and a counterpart to international financial institutions and fora, making many valuable contributions to the international dialogue on the global financial system. Back in 1983 when the Institute was founded – in response to the international debt crisis – one of its key jobs was to provide its members with information about the policies and performance of borrowing countries. As time passed by, the range of the Institute’s activities broadened and it has worked as well on such issues as global financial regulation. Moreover, it played an active role during the last number of years in the debate about the international financial architecture and emerging market policy issues. Celebrating today’s anniversary brings to mind not only the many policy issues that we discussed over the past 25 years but also the many colleagues and friends from all parts of the world whose professional careers are in various ways linked to the development of the international financial system and to the issues that the Institute has been dealing with. I myself have interacted with the IIF on many occasions, not only back in the 1980s when I was chairman of the Paris Club, but also thereafter in my capacity as governor of the Banque de France and today as President of the European Central Bank. In my talk today, I will seize the opportunity of the 25th anniversary of the Institute and share with you some thoughts on two broad issues that I deem particularly relevant. First, I will recall the past financial crises that have hit emerging market countries over the last two and a half decades and focus on the progress that has been achieved with regard to devising mechanisms for crisis prevention and crisis containment. Second, I will take a closer look at the recent turmoil in financial markets and provide some preliminary reflections. II.  Emerging market countries and their access to international financial markets  The financial integration of countries into the global economy continues at a high pace. While advanced countries are the most financially integrated, emerging market countries have significantly increased their cross border asset and liabilities positions and hence improve their degree of integration. The tremendous benefits that are associated with this integration process in terms of rising living standards and overall prosperity should not be taken for granted though since globalisation and rising capital mobility require taking into account the possibility of shocks spilling over into different countries. The financial crises that we have witnessed over the last 25 years and that were largely confined to emerging market and developing countries have not been few: The debt crises during the 1980s that started with Poland and Mexico and spread to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union; some years later, the Mexican crisis in 1994; the Asian crisis starting in 1997; the Russian crisis in 1998; and the Argentinian crisis in 2001-02. As is well known, the composition of private capital flows to emerging market and developing countries in the periods before and after the crisis of the 1980s differed substantially. Looking at World Bank Global Development Finance data, from the 1973 oil price shock until the 1982 Mexican crisis bank lending amounted to almost two thirds of overall private capital flows, dwarfing bond financing and equity flows, which stood at below 5 percent and 17  BIS Review 119/2007  1  \fpercent respectively. This composition of private capital flows changed dramatically in the 1990s. In the period between 1990 and 1997, while bank lending made up only 12 percent, FDI and portfolio equity flows as well as bond financing combined had risen to an impressive 80 percent of overall private capital inflows. In hindsight, the 1989 Brady Plan of collateralized debt reduction could be seen as paramount in paving the way for these significant changes. That said, and irrespective of whether the crisis took place in the 1980s or 1990s, all of these crises have in common that they not only imposed major macroeconomic costs on emerging market countries and led to significant financial losses on the part of commercial banks and bond holders in mature economies. These events posed also major threats to the international financial system. What is important to note, though, is that the international community managed to resolve all of these crises. This was so because the international institutions and forums that are charged with crisis resolution were up to their responsibilities. Moreover, measures were taken by sovereigns in emerging market countries and the private sector in mature economies to fight these crises. Going forward, an important lesson that we have learned from these events is that our efforts aimed to strengthen the global financial architecture need to continue tirelessly to ensure that the resilience of the global financial system is preserved. Updating the effectiveness of this architecture in the areas of crisis prevention and crisis management is an ongoing task, and many crucial steps have been taken, and are being taken, to this end. Over the last number of years, it has of course been the preventive rather than the resolving mechanisms that have been more relevant. In this respect I would like to focus not so much on the various institutional adjustments of the international financial architecture, but concentrate on a subject that I deem particularly relevant, namely the development and implementation of international financial standards and codes. Such tools, which set out widely accepted good principles, practices, rules and guidelines, determine the interaction between public policy and market functioning. They serve as effective mechanisms for crisis prevention and crisis containment and hence do deserve a closer look. Following the Asian crisis, the need to strengthen the international financial architecture was widely recognized. A major initiative was clearly the creation of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in 1999 and its work on developing and implementing financial standards and codes. Most relevant are the 12 standards that the FSF has designated as key to strengthening and preserving the soundness of financial systems and that cover a broad range of subject areas. These standards pertain to macroeconomic policy and transparency, institutional and market infrastructure as well as financial regulation and supervision. As far as creation and implementation of these standards is concerned, many international institutions and fora have been involved, including the G20, the Basel-based committees, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the International Financial Institutions. The progress that has been made over the last number of years is truly impressive. For example, as of today, three quarters of the Fund membership has completed more than 840 modules of the IMF’s Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes, the so-called ROSCs. Moreover, more than a third of the IMF’s member countries subscribe to its special standard for dissemination of economic and financial data, the SDDS. Finally, more than 60 percent of the Fund membership has so far completed a Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). That said, further improvements should be sought in respect of participation rates, including also as regards the reporting to the IMF on the currency composition of countries’ foreign exchange reserves. Why does the implementation of internationally agreed standards and codes play such an important role when it comes to the prevention of financial crises? There are a number of benefits that bear emphasis. At the national level, these tools do not only help anchor market expectations as they make more predictable future macroeconomic and financial policy  2  BIS Review 119/2007  \fmeasures. They also make institutions, markets, infrastructure and policies more transparent, thus mitigating the risks of disruptive developments. Moreover, international financial stability is promoted and the risks of financial distress are curbed through betterinformed lending and investment decisions. In passing, I would also note the more widespread use of market-based policy frameworks in many countries that has been highly conducive to preventing financial crises. Another consideration that deserves emphasis is that standards and codes do not necessarily have to be set and enforced solely by public authorities. Rather, the private sector in many instances plays an important role, and rightly so. Indeed, there can be no doubt that ensuring transparency and an appropriate flow of information is the responsibility of both the public and the private sector. One example of private sector involvement in the area of international standards relates to accounting and auditing where private sector organisations are the issuing bodies. Another prominent example – one that relates directly to the work of the IIF – are the “Principles for stable capital flows and debt restructuring in emerging markets”, on which I will now elaborate in more detail. The Principles, which have been agreed between sovereign debtors and their private creditors, serve a number of important purposes. They aim to foster transparency and the timely flow of information between debtors and creditors. Moreover, they seek to ensure close debtor-creditor dialogue and cooperation to avoid restructuring. In cases where a debt restructuring becomes inevitable, the Principles request relevant parties to pursue good faith actions and call for fair treatment of affected creditors. With regard to the creation of the Principles, I remember launching the idea at a luncheon organised by the Bretton Woods Committee in 2001. What was important then, and is of course today, is the clear support that the Principles received from private sector representatives as well as public officials of the issuing countries. Indeed, the work that has been done by the IIF in this area and its backing has been, and continues to be, highly valuable. And I remember that the first mention of the “Principles” in a communiqué of the G20 was made in New Dehli. When it comes to awareness and implementation of the Principles, I am very pleased to see that further progress has been achieved. A rising number of sovereign debtors and international investors have underlined their backing for the Principles and have already applied them. What is the Principles’ formula for success and why is it that commitment to, and compliance with, the Principles is advancing? I believe that the answers to these questions lie in the Principles’ design features. The Principles are not a heavy-handed mandatory approach, but a soft mode of governance: they incorporate strictly voluntary, market-based, and flexible guidelines which are applied on a case-by-case basis. Talking about the market-based approach to avoiding and resolving sovereign debt crises, I should also mention collective action clauses (CACs) that are incorporated into international sovereign bonds. While there was not much enthusiasm for CACs back in 1996 when the G10 Rey report was published, the changing international financial landscape and the experience with the crises of the 1990s led to a fresh look at CACs and ultimately an increasing interest. We all remember well how the Mexican government assumed the role of an icebreaker and in February 2003 announced a bond issue with CACs. Many other countries have followed Mexico’s example, and today CACs are a standard provision in international bonds. As a consequence, the share of outstanding emerging market sovereign bonds including CACs has now reached two third. What is worth underlining, and confirmed by empirical evidence, is that, contrary to earlier concerns, CACs have not significantly affected the price of the bonds or the levels of subscription. In concluding, I would point out that there are many examples of international standards and codes – be they agreed solely by the public sector, jointly by the public and the private sector or by the private sector only – that have proven highly useful as tools for crisis prevention. They are woven into the fabric of the international financial architecture and make an  BIS Review 119/2007  3  \fimportant contribution to strengthening the resilience of the international financial system. Finally, what ought to be stressed is that for standards and codes to retain their relevance, policymakers and standard-setters are faced with the constant challenge to ensure that these instruments are mutually consistent and regularly updated so that they are in line with the fast changing global financial environment. III.  Mature economies and the recent turmoil in financial markets  Let me now move from some lessons of past crises in emerging economies to the situation we are now facing in the global financial system. What has been notable about recent experience is that the epicentre of market turbulence has shifted from the emerging economies. This we saw during the bursting of the “dot com bubble” at the beginning of the decade and now, a financial market liquidity squeeze that simultaneously affected many advanced economies was triggered in late July this year. It began with a loss of confidence in the valuations of credit market securities where the underlying assets are US sub-prime mortgages and it quickly spread, causing disruptions in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market and eventually, by way of consequence, in the unsecured inter-bank money markets as concerns mounted about counterparty credit risks. Several markets were affected by the turbulence and the spill-over effects were generally characterised by losses of market liquidity and heightened market volatility. It is important to note that the present significant market correction is not an event that should surprise us. We had been quite clear, since a number of months if not years in stressing a global phenomenon of underpricing of risks which was signaled in particular by a low level of volatility, a low level of spreads, a low level of risk premia across the board in a large array of products and markets. In many respect the present episode can be interpreted as correcting those anomalies and paving the way – once the turbulences would have dissipated – for a more sustainable structure of global finance. That being said even if the likelihood and even the necessity of a market correction was largely recognised by the public as well as the private sector, the channels that were the vehicles for the propagation of the turbulences were not identified ex ante. Several observations can be made in this respect. First, despite the fact that over recent years credit risk transfer has facilitated a widespread sharing of risk in the financial system, the recent market turbulence has nevertheless confirmed pre-existing concerns about the risks stemming from a lack of transparency about where credit risks ultimately reside in the financial system. Paradoxically in a large number of cases the credit risk remained in the realm of the commercial banks through the commitment they still had to activate back up lines of conduits or structured investment vehicles. Second, even if the risks were well dispersed across the system, the recent events have illustrated the importance of adverse selection problems in a crisis situation in that even a suspicion that counterparties could have modest exposures to assets for which no market value can be computed can significantly impair market functioning. Third, the financial market turmoil has highlighted vulnerabilities created by off-balance sheet special investment vehicles set up mostly by banks. Such vehicles have proven to be more prone to liquidity mismatches than anticipated, which, as a result, caused contingent credit lines to be drawn on banks. Finally, the fact that the problems were related to the rolling over of secured short-term financing instruments rather than unsecured instruments highlighted the risks created by excessive reliance on ratings in valuing complex assets which are used as collateral in shortterm asset-backed commercial paper markets. Although some signs of normalisation of credit market conditions emerged throughout September and early October, for global financial institutions the turbulence in the financial  4  BIS Review 119/2007  \fmarkets has clearly created some challenges. Many large institutions have been warning that future earnings will be materially affected as a result of both direct and indirect exposures to US sub-prime mortgage securities. Nevertheless, after several years of strong profit growth, capital bases are comfortably in excess of regulatory requirements. As a result, the global financial system – especially the core financial institutions within it – has remained resilient. Looking forward, the uncertainty as to how market liquidity problems will eventually be resolved clearly complicates the assessment of the medium-term outlook for financial stability, both globally and in the euro area. Given the relative strength of the underlying fundamentals – although pockets of vulnerability do exist – the central scenario is that the impact of the financial turbulence on the intermediation of credit is likely to be relatively contained. Nevertheless, low probability but plausible and challenging scenarios for financial stability could be triggered by adverse disturbances that affect global market liquidity conditions or if unanticipated credit events were to occur. Let me draw some further, albeit preliminary, lessons and putting forward tentative suggestions. First, it is important to keep in mind that the recent market liquidity squeeze originated from a surge in defaults by a sub-set of borrowers with particularly weak credit fundamentals. As the global credit cycle advances, one can hope that default rates do not start rising in other parts of the credit markets. We need to monitor the situation closely in order to identify any such adverse spill-over effects. Second, an important factor holding back market liquidity in the credit and money markets at the current juncture seems to be uncertainties about the ultimate holders of assets and derivatives where credit quality has deteriorated. In such an environment, further voluntary disclosure by both banks and non-regulated entities – including conduits, special purpose vehicles, etc – could work as an important signalling mechanism that would allow investors to re-assess positions and gradually help the market for structured finance to start functioning again. Third, for financial institutions, the period ahead is likely to provide a first material test of the effects of changing banking business models to one whereby the securitisation of bank assets and the role of non-bank financial institutions have become increasingly important. Although currently profitable and well capitalised, many banks will experience income and credit losses, which may trigger a re-assessment by some of them of the suitability of this socalled “originate-and-distribute” business model. With regard to hedge funds, they have not been at the centre of the turmoil. An important lesson in this regard is that many funds with solid financing structures and/or strategies geared towards distressed asset management are likely to have prospered from recent events, thereby smoothening volatility and mitigating the effects of a financial de-leveraging process. Finally, certain supervisory and regulatory issues can already be identified as warranting further attention or action. Initiatives are already underway at the European and international level to draw lessons and consider further policy actions. Whilst it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions, there is a common understanding on the need for finding solutions that can be applied consistently at the global level. In this respect, international coordination is of the utmost importance, as any policy action should be applied consistently, thus ensuring a level playing field globally. Turning to possible lessons from a regulatory and supervisory viewpoint, I would stress first of all the importance of effective implementation of Basel II which, despite the possible need for some revisions in light of the recent financial market developments, provides a sound basis for banking supervision and incentives for improvements in banks’ risk management. Second, I would mention three key areas that warrant further attention on the part of the international community. First, banks need to further improve their risk management, in particular liquidity risk management. The complexity of structured finance products calls for  BIS Review 119/2007  5  \fbanks to have in place commensurately sophisticated risk management systems, including liquidity risk stress-testing. Second, the role rating agencies played in the recent events needs to be assessed. In particular, a better insight is needed into the incentive structures, including possible conflicts of interest, to perform proper due diligence. At the same time, the possible lack of incentives for investors to carry out their own credit analysis and due diligence should also be taken into account. Third, certain areas of the regulatory framework may need to be reviewed, such as the treatment of liquidity risk and the securitisation framework, in particular the treatment of liquidity exposures to special purpose vehicles and the assessment of risk transfer, given their significance in the recent financial turbulences. Let me conclude by stressing that I am confident that from this process, an even stronger financial system will emerge, which will be well able to face the future challenges for the global intermediation of credit. IV.  Concluding remarks  One important lesson that we have learned from past financial crises and that should be applied at the current juncture is that fostering transparency proves to be an effective mechanism for both crisis prevention and crisis containment. This is so because ensuring transparency through the appropriate disclosure of information reduces uncertainties on the part of market participants, thus leading to less disruptive market movements and overshooting. Moreover, transparency helps minimise contagion in all compartments of global finance, not least through its preventive, but also dampening, impact on herd behaviour of market participants. Enabling market participants to differentiate across players and to price risks appropriately is therefore a highly valuable outcome. As we have seen, the concept of transparency relates to many different areas such as the domain of sovereign risks and the interaction between sovereign borrowers and their private creditors and investors as well as to financial markets of industrialized countries. While I am firmly convinced that more progress ought to be achieved when it comes to introducing transparency in the various areas of the global financial system, I am equally convinced that we do not need heavy-handed public sector regulation to reach our goals. On the contrary, there are many examples of both self-regulation by the financial industry and joint governance involving both the private and the public sector. One promising recent initiative are the benchmarks for best practices that a number of highly leveraged institutions have worked out voluntarily. Another example that has proven highly successful are the Principles for stable capital flows on which I have elaborated before. In sum, I would underline that it is the task of all the stakeholders of the global financial system, regardless of whether they belong to the private or the public sector, to live up to their respective responsibilities and contribute appropriately to the stability of this system. In this context, the IIF has made very significant and valuable contributions during the last 25 years, and I look forward to its future work.  6  BIS Review 119/2007</td>\n",

Framework Agreement Address by Mr Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the event marking the first signatures to the T2S Framework Agreement, Frankfurt am Main, 8 May 2012. *  *  *  Ladies and gentlemen, It is no exaggeration to say that today is a historic date for the T2S project. It marks the end of more than two years of negotiations on the T2S Framework Agreement, one of the most critical legal documents underlying the whole project. The President reminded us in his address of how important it is to cooperate if we want to achieve our Single Market objectives. T2S is a clear example of the very good cooperation amongst stakeholders in the post-trade industry: as of today, the spirit of the project will move on from negotiation to cooperation. We shall work together with the CSDs to implement T2S – for the benefit of the European financial markets. I would now like to congratulate the CSDs that signed the Framework Agreement today. They have demonstrated their willingness to adapt to change. They will play a central role until T2S goes live by preparing and conducting the testing of the system, and they will help us to ensure that the operations of T2S run smoothly from the beginning. This is especially true for those CSDs that will transfer their operations to T2S as part of the first migration waves. It is in acknowledgement of this contribution that those CSDs will be entitled to financial incentives reserved for the early joiners . I am delighted to welcome them to T2S. The CSDs that signed the Framework Agreement today represent about two-thirds of the total settlement volume in the euro area. In addition, several other CSDs are expected to join over the next few weeks, once their feasibility assessments are complete. In total, we expect to reach more than 90% – possibly 100% – of the euro settlement volume by June 2012. T2S is a truly European project, which is capable of generating great economies of scale and of bringing benefits to its users and to Europe as a whole. It is a network business: the larger the volumes settled in T2S, the more benefits for all of its participants, in terms of cost reduction and collateral savings. A large participation in T2S will also result in a wide harmonisation of practices and procedures across Europe – harmonisation, which will, in turn, bring significant efficiency gains for T2S participants. The close involvement of CSDs has been a crucial factor throughout the project so far, and it will become even more crucial from now on. I wish to join the President in congratulating those who have been involved in the project’s governance. T2S is an entirely new concept. It is unique and nothing comparable has ever been done before. From the inception to the go‐live, it will have required the engagement and collaboration of numerous different stakeholders, from the industry, from central banks and from other public authorities. Effective cooperation is key to the success of T2S. Decisions need to take into account several different points of view, while ensuring that the final outcome meets the objectives set in pursuit of deeper market integration in Europe. This complexity is the reason why we had to develop a specific governance structure to manage the project. Let me dedicate a few words to the governance bodies that have made the T2S Framework Agreement a reality: the T2S Programme Board and the CSD Contact Group. The T2S Programme Board has run the daily management of the project up to now, regularly reporting to the Governing Council of the ECB. I would like to thank the members of the T2S Programme Board for their dedication and commitment over the past three years. They  BIS central bankers’ speeches  1  \n",
       "have coordinated effectively the several work streams constituting the project and fulfilled the mandate they were given by the Governing Council. They have made an enormous contribution to making the project a success. My gratitude also goes to the members of the CSD Contact Group, the main forum for the Framework Agreement negotiations, which has played an instrumental role in ensuring that a mutually satisfactory agreement could be reached. Following the signatures of the T2S Framework Agreement in June, the role of these two governance bodies will be assumed by their successor bodies: the T2S Board and the CSD Steering Group. In this new phase of cooperation, the T2S Board will concentrate on the implementation and testing of the T2S platform, and then on the CSD migration to the new settlement environment. The CSD Steering Group will articulate and coordinate the views of the participating CSDs within the T2S governance. A major change to the current setting is that the Chair of the CSD Steering Group will be a CSD representative. Together, the two groups will cooperate to make sure that T2S delivers on its promises. I trust they will continue the good work accomplished so far. I would also like to thank the T2S Advisory Group. In the next phase of the project, this group will retain its important function of ensuring that T2S delivers in line with market needs. The group has provided invaluable advice to the Programme Board and to the Governing Council over the past few years. The level of transparency on the T2S project through the Advisory Group has been – I believe – unprecedented. This has certainly been one of the key drivers of the project’s acceptance amongst CSDs, market participants and political authorities. Finally, I wish to thank the High Level Group T2S as well as the T2S teams both at the ECB and the 4CB. Their work is not always visible, but it is invaluable. Indeed it is thanks to their work “backstage” that the construction of the T2S platform is well on track. The system is now over halfway to delivery point and the development and testing of the application are proceeding on a firm footing. On this basis, and with the signature of the T2S contracts, we now have the solid foundations to continue building T2S and to transform post-trading in Europe, making it both more efficient and safer. We have taken a major step today towards making T2S happen. In years to come, we will see the Eurosystem, participating CSDs, and market participants more widely working together to make this project a success. Thank you very much.  2  BIS central bankers’ speeches  \n",

Comparing transatlantic responses to the financial crisis Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Panel session “Taking stock: Global implications of transatlantic differences”, of the Conference organised by Bank of Italy, Bruegel and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Rome, 10-11 September 2009. *  *  *  This conference has examined in detail how policy authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have reacted to the financial crisis. I won’t consider in depth the events of the past two years. Let me just say that central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have responded swiftly and decisively, especially since September of last year, working very closely together, even to the point of coordinating some of their actions. Indeed, you doubtless remember that the first interest rate reduction in the easing cycle, on 8 October 2008, was a coordinated move by a number of major central banks. Market interest rates are now at very similar levels. For instance, the money market interest rates at the twelve-month horizon both in the US and the euro area are currently just below 1.3%. 1 Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic have also resorted to a number of non-standard measures to provide additional support and stimulus to their respective economies. The choice and design of those measures reflects the structural characteristics of those economies. The non-standard measures implemented by the ECB have focused primarily on banks, as banks are the main source of funding in the euro area economy. In the US, however, market-based financing plays a more important role. The ECB’s framework for non-conventional measures comprises five main building blocks: meeting in full the banks’ liquidity requests at a fixed rate; expanding the list of assets eligible as collateral; lengthening the maturities of long-term refinancing operations; providing liquidity in foreign currencies; and, since July, supporting the financial market by making outright purchases of covered bonds. These measures are by now well known. We consider that they have achieved the desired objectives, in particular by reducing the spreads in the money market, flattening the yield curve over the short-term horizon and restarting the market for covered bonds – an important instrument through which banks finance themselves. So much for recent measures. Today, though, I’d like to look ahead and talk about a topic which has been widely discussed at recent international meetings: the exit strategy. This strategy sets a course for progressively reversing the policy measures that were implemented in recent months, i.e. the interest rate levels and non-standard instruments. Let me make it quite clear: this is not – yet – the time to implement the exit strategy. We clearly stated our view last week that the level of interest rate is appropriate, and we decided to conduct another one-year refinancing operation at the MRO rate (1%) with full allotment. But it’s critical to have a well thought-out exit strategy, because markets have to realise that the current policy is temporary and will be reversed when it is no longer appropriate, in particular when risks to price stability re-emerge and conditions in financial markets have improved. As far as the euro area is concerned, the primary goal of monetary policy remains  1  On Friday 4 September 2009, three, six and 12 month rates in the US (LIBOR) stood at 0.31%, 0.71% and 1.29%.

       "price stability; and the ECB will do whatever is needed to carry out its mandate. Inflation expectations over the medium term have to remain well anchored. This is essential to ensure that long-term interest rates remain low, thereby supporting the economic recovery. Having an exit strategy is thus an act of responsibility for a central bank. Drawing up an exit strategy entails two questions above all: how? and when? I won’t touch upon the how – the instruments – as both Chairman Bernanke and President Trichet have examined this particular question recently. 2 Instead, I will address the issue of the when from an analytical point of view. The concrete implementation will depend on many imponderables, not least the prospects for economic recovery and for the stabilisation of financial markets – and those prospects are fraught with uncertainty. I intend to discuss a few issues that – in my view – central banks will have to consider when taking the decision to exit. This will show how complex and difficult that decision is going to be. My analysis does not pretend to be exhaustive, but in my view the following five issues demand our full attention. One issue is reversibility. Once the decision has been taken, we can’t easily go back on it. This seems pretty obvious, but it has some deeper implications. Let me explain. If the decision to exit is taken too late and monetary expansion continues for too long, fresh seeds of instability in the financial sector are sown. On the other hand, if the decision is taken too early, the economic recovery might be undermined. Mistakes in the timing, both premature and tardy, (what I would call type I and type II errors) have been made in the past. The solution is to do it right, obviously. Some might think that these errors are not so worrying because they can be remedied while the exit policy is being implemented. If the decision to exit has been taken too early, for instance, the central bank might slow things down. If, however, the decision has been taken too late, the exit can be speeded up. It sounds nice, but is a bit too easy. Why? Because the decision to exit is bound to have an impact on agents’ interest rate expectations throughout the whole yield curve, and lead to substantial portfolio reallocations. This is desirable, and inevitable, as the purpose of the exit strategy is indeed to change the behaviour of the private sector. But if the adjustment in expectations is large, it can lead to disruptions that affect financial stability and in turn jeopardise the sustainability of the whole exit strategy. In particular, any late exit which needs to be accelerated could produce unexpected shocks, for instance in the form of losses in the fixed income market which could hamper attempts by financial institutions to progressively regain access to the funding market. The effects of such a delay might lead to a prolongation of the non-standard measures which were supposed to be phased out. Remember the 1994 episode, when a mere 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate gave rise to major losses in the bond market (reflecting the fact that it was probably a bit too late). The losses then constrained the future moves, which had to be relatively more gradualistic. The second issue relates to the uncertainties surrounding the analytical framework that central banks have at their disposal in order to decide on the optimal interest rate path. Ideally, the stance of monetary policy should be calibrated in such a way as to avoid an implicit easing of monetary conditions as the economy recovers. This implies that the interest rate should be raised as the economy starts growing above its potential rate and as the output gap starts closing. The problem with this framework is that it is very difficult to  2  2  See the speech by ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, “The ECB’s exit strategy”, Frankfurt, 4 September 2009, and testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington, D.C., 21 July 2009.  BIS Review 107/2009  \n",
       "estimate potential growth and the size of the output gap, especially after a shock like the one experienced over the last two years. Looking at the past, the major policy mistakes have been made as a result of overestimating potential growth and the size of the output gap, in particular during a recovery. This has led monetary policy to be overly activist and has delayed the tightening phase, thus fuelling financial instability. The two-pillar strategy of the ECB has helped to reduce this type of risk, as monetary and credit aggregates have been used as indicators of a strengthened economy, while inflationary pressures were still subdued. In the current phase, we might have to take into consideration the fact that the ongoing process of de-leveraging in the financial sector, which is likely to take place for some time as a result of the correction of the previous credit bubble, might affect the signalling content of money and credit aggregates. To be sure, the tightening phase cannot wait until inflation materialises, but will have to precede it. This is even more the case this time around, given the very low level to which interest rates have been reduced, and the distance from the steady state level that will need to be attained. The latter is in itself very difficult to determine, given the uncertainties about some of the longer-term developments in the economy. This will, as usual, present some communication challenges, such as having to answer the question commonly put to central bankers under these circumstances: “Why are you raising interest rates if there is no inflation?” The pace of the tightening will obviously depend on the underlying conditions, in particular the speed of the recovery. Given the uncertainties, it would be inappropriate to commit to any specific path ex ante. Another issue to take into account is the exit strategy from fiscal policy. I will not dwell on this issue, which is undoubtedly a challenging one per se. But there is a link with the exit from monetary policy and it will have to be considered. In particular, the more delayed the fiscal exit, ceteris paribus, the more the monetary policy exit might have to be brought forward. Indeed, given the level of the debt accumulated in most advanced economies, any delay in the fiscal exit is likely to have an effect on inflation expectations, and may even disanchor them. This is a risk that monetary policy cannot take, as it would undermine its overall strategy. On the subject of inflation expectations, allow me to digress briefly. Inflation expectations are an important indicator for central banks, as they reflect their credibility in achieving price stability. However, recent experience suggests that central banks should not be too complacent, even when expectations appear to be anchored, as the private sector might not always be a good predictor of future developments. Over the previous cycle, inflation expectations seemed to be well anchored, but partially concealed the build-up of asset market instability and longer-run threats to price stability. Well-anchored inflation expectations are a necessary condition for an appropriate monetary policy, but not a sufficient one. Let me touch on a final issue, related to financial stability. The exit strategy for the interest rate policy will be defined on the basis of the primary objective: price stability. In this respect, financial stability can only be a secondary objective. If it were given the same priority as price stability, the latter would obviously be compromised. The exit from the non-standard measures is likely to be linked to the state of the financial markets, and in this respect can partly be disconnected from the interest rate policy. Given the design of the non-standard instruments implemented by the ECB, the exit from those instruments can take place before or after the interest rate decision, without major effects on it. However, if at the time of the exit a number of financial institutions are still addicted to central bank liquidity, the transmission channel of monetary policy might be impaired. It is not the central bank’s task to continue providing liquidity to financial institutions which are not able to stand on their own feet, once the turmoil is over. It is the responsibility of the  BIS Review 107/2009  3  \n",
       "supervisory authorities, and ultimately of Treasuries, to address the problems of these addicted banks as soon as possible, through recapitalisation and restructuring, as appropriate, and to ensure that all banks in their jurisdictions can stand on their own feet even without the central bank’s facilities. Let me conclude. I have tried to identify some of the issues which will have to be considered in implementing the exit strategy on both sides of the Atlantic. My observations have been purely analytical, and do not aim to provide any insight into specific monetary policy decisions over the next few months. My purpose was to explain parts of the analytical framework in which central banks will have to operate, on this and that side of the Atlantic. Just like the entry, the exit will also call for close interaction between the monetary authorities. This might not necessarily mean coordinated action or similar measures, given the different situations. However, the challenges ahead are quite similar. Ultimately, if we want to avoid “being too late” or “being too early”, the only solution is to “be right on time”. And this is what we are committed to doing.  4  BIS Review 107/2009  \n",

Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at Alpbach Talks, Vienna, 15 June 2009. *  *  *  Introduction Ten years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was introduced as the common currency of 11 Member States of the European Union. Today, the euro is used by around 330 million citizens in 16 countries and it has established itself as a stable currency, accepted in financial markets worldwide. Looking at the inflation performance over the first decade of Monetary Union with inflation averaging slightly more than 2% during this period, the ECB has fulfilled its mandate under the Maastricht Treaty, which is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole. Nonetheless, undoubtfully, we are currently facing the biggest challenge so far: The world is hit by a severe economic and financial downturn, the deepest since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929. It poses grave challenges to the financial industry and central bank community, as well as to supervisory and regulatory authorities and national governments and to the citizens at large. The key challenges arising from the current financial market turbulence Since August 2007 the global financial markets have experienced extensive corrective realignments. The repercussions of the turbulence were initially visible in the financial market in the form of dramatic increases in risk premia and increased volatility in interest rate movements. The outbreak of the financial market turbulence was not entirely unexpected, however. Both the ECB and other institutions had warned of macroeconomic imbalances and systematic undervaluation of risks in the years leading up to the crisis. Those years were characterised by an extended period of low interest rates, low inflation and sustained economic growth, both globally and within the euro area. At the same time, liquidity was abundant and default risks were considered by many to be very low. This environment strengthened investors’ risk appetite. In particular, with financial market participants expecting this environment to continue for quite some time, risks were systematically underestimated and the search for ever higher yields intensified. As a result, commercial banks readily granted credit for house purchases to households that otherwise could not have afforded it, and without adequately assessing their creditworthiness or credit default risk. At the same time, in an attempt to achieve higher yields, a number of innovative and increasingly complex financial products were offered, particularly in the United States. One prominent example of this was the bundling of mortgages in new and highly complex financial products and their resale as new securities to third parties via global financial markets. It eventually became evident that this practice was viable only as long as house prices in the United States continued to increase. When the many years of increases in house prices came to an end and house prices started to fall, problems soon emerged, including in the euro area, as banks here were among the buyers of these securities. Investors suddenly began to doubt the quality of their assets. This led to a sharp correction in prices on the financial markets, accompanied by a withdrawal of funds from the markets, leading to corresponding liquidity shortages for banks, particularly in the money market.  BIS Review 75/2009  1  \n",
       "Response to the crisis From the very beginning of the crisis, the ECB has acted in a decisive manner. It has taken a number of measures unprecedented in nature, scope and timing. The ECB has provided large amounts of liquidity support to banks. By making changes to its operational framework, the ECB made sure that all solvent banks would have sufficient access to funding. When the crisis intensified in September last year, we introduced a number of new measures. Most importantly, we provided banks with unlimited access to liquidity at fixed rates for up to six months. The ECB also expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations. Moreover, we recently announced further measures, namely to provide longer term refinancing up to one year and to purchase covered bonds of up to EUR 60 bn. As a result of these new measures, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has expanded by a substantial EUR 600 billion and now stands at 16% of GDP, compared with 10% in mid-2007. The measures taken by the ECB have eased banks’ balance sheet constraints and thereby certainly helped to avoid a sudden collapse in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis. Moreover, in line with the substantial weakening of global demand and economic activity, inflationary pressures and risks have been diminishing. As a result, the ECB’s policy rates have been cut by 3.25 percentage points since the intensification of the crisis last October. These rate reductions, together with the liquidity management measures, have had a significant impact on money market interest rates. Since last October overnight money market rates have fallen even more steeply than the ECB’s policy rates. Money market rates in the euro area have now reached very low levels by international standards. Lower money market rates have also led to lower interest rates for private households and firms, although the decline in money market rates has so far been greater than the decline in interest rates on credit for households and firms. The fiscal authorities in the euro area have also demonstrated their capacity to react rapidly to exceptional circumstances. In a coordinated effort, the national governments of the euro area have provided support to the banking system, most notably through recapitalisation and guarantees for liabilities and assets. The funds provided under the package announced to stabilise the financial sector through these types of measure amount to 23% of the euro area’s GDP. The overall fiscal stimulus – through discretionary policy measures and the effect of automatic stabilisers – amounts to 3.6 percentage points of GDP for 2009 and 2010. Overall, during the ongoing financial market turbulence, the euro area and the EU as a whole have proved their capacity to act decisively and promptly under difficult circumstances. Lessons from the crisis The current financial crisis has pointed to a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed if we are to avoid a similar crisis in the future. Some weaknesses are rooted in the current design of the international financial system. This is particularly true with regard to the lack of transparency and accountability within the financial system. In this respect, much relies on financial players themselves taking responsibility for evaluating risk more effectively and increasing transparency as regards risk. In addition, various initiatives at national, European and international level aim, in particular, to improve the robustness of the financial system I would like to highlight three areas where I think change is necessary: there needs to be an increase in transparency, a dampening of pro-cyclicality and an improvement in institutional design in the field of financial supervision and regulation. First, we need to undergo global regulatory and supervisory repair. The Basel Committee has already set some milestones in this regard including the publication of the principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision and its current work on strengthening the  2  BIS Review 75/2009  \n",
       "Basel II capital framework. Work is also underway concerning the development of measures to mitigate pro-cyclicality stemming from the regulatory frameworks, namely by building buffers in good times that can be withdrawn in less benign conditions. In this context, let me recall that the G20 Leaders approved the recommendations by the FSB to address procyclicality, which are to be implemented by the end of this year. To this aim, the Basel Committee is developing proposals for countercyclical buffers and ways to promote provisioning over the cycle, with the aim to come up with concrete proposals by year-end. Second, regulatory gaps need to be closed. In that respect, the G20 Leaders endorsed last April the extension of the regulatory net to all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments. These include systemically important hedge funds, credit rating agencies and Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives markets. With the aim of preventing regulatory arbitrage, the IMF together with the FSB, have been requested to develop, by autumn, guidelines to assess systemic importance. And third, macro-prudential supervision has to be strengthened. This includes in particular the global monitoring of systemic stability and the supervision of systemically important cross-border institutions, while properly addressing interlinkages among themselves, with other financial and non-financial institutions and markets. In this context, I fully support the broadened mandate and stronger institutional basis given to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The G20 Leaders called on the re-established FSB to develop macro-prudential tools, together with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), to identify and take account of macro-prudential risks across the financial system and limit the build up of systemic risk for regulated entities. Moreover, the envisaged cooperation between the IMF and the FSB for the conduct of Early Warning Exercises will be crucial for the success of the global monitoring of systemic risks. At the European level, the proposal of the De Larosière group to establish a European Systemic Risk Council should substantially improve the assessment of risks to financial stability at the EU level. In order for the new Council to perform its tasks in an optimal manner – in my view – three requirements must be fulfilled. First, the ECB must have timely access to the relevant information, including information concerning individual institutions. Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action. And third, for the new Council to be independent and effective in its decision-making, it is essential that it have a solid institutional and legal basis. I also think the current crisis holds some lessons for monetary policy. The crisis has shown us that a stable financial system is a prerequisite for price stability. Monetary policy-makers should try to mitigate the risk of the build-up of financial bubbles by being aware of the effects their policy decisions can have on the financial system. Therefore, one could argue that asset prices should play a greater role in monetary policy considerations. As the build-up of an asset price bubble might have severe economic consequences in the longer term, central banks should try to deal with the bubble pre-emptively. Nonetheless, the interrelation of financial stability goes beyond the pure consideration of asset prices. Analysing developments in borrowing and lending, particularly loans to the private sector, is helpful in extracting the relevant signals from monetary developments on potential financial imbalances. Consideration of these aspects must become more extensive and systematic in the future. Strengthening the ECB’s role in financial supervision should contribute to ensuring that proper consideration is given to the possible build-up of financial imbalances when making monetary policy decisions. The current crisis has clearly demonstrated that risks to financial stability are accompanied by risks to price stability. Central banks must give even greater consideration to these risks in their analyses.  BIS Review 75/2009  3  \n",
       "The benefits of the euro in the current crisis As mentioned, the current crisis represents the greatest challenge for the euro so far. 2009 will be a very difficult year. According to the most recent macroeconomic projections by ECB staff, published in June of this year, the euro area economy is expected to contract by between 4.1% and 5.1% in 2009. This means, among other things, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, less investment and less exports. That said, we should not forget how Europe would look today without the euro. In addition to the financial market turbulence, the problems in the financial sector and the economic downturn, we would be facing potentially large fluctuations between Europe’s national currencies. In fact, the currencies of some of the countries outside the euro area have experienced considerable fluctuations during the current crisis. This is an additional source of uncertainty for these countries. Therefore, the turmoil has confirmed one clear advantage of the euro, namely that, in stormy seas, it is better to be aboard a large ship than a small boat. This seems to be also reflected in the fact that many central and eastern European countries have expressed the wish to join the euro area as quickly as possible. This is no surprise, given that many countries have already made progress towards adopting the euro. Nevertheless, all countries must first fulfil all of the relevant criteria before joining the euro area. Still, I would like to emphasise that the euro area is not a closed shop. Five new countries have joined since the start of Monetary Union in January 1999, with Slovakia becoming the newest member of the euro area in January of this year. The door is open to all those that meet the clearly stated and predefined criteria for membership of the Economic and Monetary Union. Conclusion Joseph Schumpeter coined the expression of the creative destruction to bring about entrepreneurial innovation and progress. Schumpeter certainly did not have in mind an economic and financial crisis of the severity and extent we are experiencing today. But having the concept of Schumpeter in mind, the current crisis also created a window of opportunity for change and reform. This window, however, will not remain open forever. Therefore, we have to act now in bringing forward the necessary reforms in the international financial system to strengthen the supervisory architecture. The ECB stands ready to take up its part on macroprudential supervision.  4  BIS Review 75/2009  \n",

Introduction Thank you very much for the invitation to speak today to this distinguished audience at the Forecasters Club here in New York. Large parts of Europe are suffering from the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. An increasing number of sovereigns are facing financing problems. A solution needs to be found urgently. But fingers are pointing in different directions. In my view solving the current sovereign debt crisis is primarily in the hands of governments. Its root cause lies in lax fiscal policies and associated deteriorating public finances in some euro area countries. Stability criteria were violated, fiscal rules ignored and statistics tweaked. Growth dividends were not used for necessary consolidation in good times. In the same vein, competitiveness positions worsened in many euro area countries, due to a lack of structural reforms. These developments have raised doubts in financial markets on the political will and capacity to live up to their commitments and to do whatever is needed to comply with the rules of the game within a monetary union. To solve the crisis requires determined fiscal consolidation and ambitious structural reforms. These must be the prime answers for tackling current challenges. At the same time, it has to be recognised that sovereign debt issues are not confined to the euro area but have become an important issue for all advanced economies. Thus, I will focus my presentation today on the policy responses to the crisis and the requirements I see as essential in the areas of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms to cope with current challenges. Macroeconomic and monetary environment Let me start with briefly sketching the economic and financial developments in the euro area during the years of crisis up to now. Following the collapse of Lehman, financial market tensions escalated in 2008. As a consequence, we witnessed a severe global recession. After the deep recession that started in 2008, euro area real GDP started to contract and stood in the first half of 2009 about 5% below its level one year earlier, compared to a contraction of the US economy of close to 5% taking into account the recent revisions to US national account data. Continued strong external demand as well as a strengthening of domestic demand where the main drivers behind the subsequent economic recovery (slide 3). At present, it seems that some of the downside risks we had identified earlier have been materialising. Looking ahead, short-term indicators and survey data suggest that real GDP growth may be very moderate towards the end of this year and at the beginning of next year. Indeed, economic activity in the euro area is adversely affected by a moderation in the pace of global demand. In addition, the crisis continues to weigh on confidence and financing conditions in the euro area. These developments are expected to dampen activity. At the same time, activity should benefit from  BIS central bankers’ speeches  1  \n",
       "continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, the continued extremely low levels of short-term interest rates and the various measures that have been implemented to support the functioning of the financial sector. Having said this, uncertainty remains very high and risks to the economic outlook on the downside. Turning to prices, average inflation in the euro area rose to 1.6% in 2010, and continued increasing in 2011. It stood at 3% in November, according the Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from previous months, still significantly lower than in the US. The main drivers behind the elevated inflation rates since the end of last year have been oil and other commodity price surges. As of late, increases in indirect taxes due to fiscal consolidation needs have been an additional driver. At the same time, domestic price pressures have remained moderate. Survey data up to October point to some easing in pipeline pressures, especially at the earlier stages of the pricing chain, i.e. producer prices for intermediate goods. In view of the rather weak growth prospects and continued slack in labour markets, labour cost pressures are likely to remain contained in the medium term. Looking ahead, euro area inflation rates are likely to decline in the coming months. They are expected to fall below 2% in the course of 2012. In the medium term, inflation rates should remain moderate. This is in line with latest available inflation forecasts from public sources. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations according to both survey and market based measures remain well anchored in line with the ECB’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. As to monetary and credit developments, following double digit growth rates in the build-up of the financial crisis, signalling risks for macroeconomic instabilities and price stability, annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 and in loans to the private sector fell sharply between 2008 and mid-2010 (slide 5). Since then, money and credit growth started to recover. However, underlying growth trends remained moderate, correcting a sizeable part of the excess liquidity that had been accumulated before the start of the crisis. Monetary policy The ECB from the very beginning of the crisis has taken decisive and swift action through both its standard and non-standard monetary policy measures. In a first response to intensified financial market tensions, and based on our assessment of medium-term risks to price stability in the euro area, we reduced our key interest rates by 325 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009 and kept them unchanged until April 2011. During this time, the main refinancing rate of the Eurosystem stood at 1%. (slide 6). Over the same period, the overnight money market interest rate (EONIA) also decreased rapidly, reaching levels as low as 0.3%. Earlier this year, in April and July, we raised interest rates in two steps, each time by 25 basis points. At that time, we were concerned that prevailing upward price pressures, mainly from energy and commodity prices, could translate into second-round effects in wage and price-setting and to broad-based inflationary pressure. However, the picture has changed since then. The economic outlook has worsened amidst continued high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. In such an environment, it is reasonable to expect moderate price, cost and wage pressure. This assessment has led us to the decision last month to reduce rates by 25 basis points. Our main refinancing rate therefore now stands at 1.25%, and the rates on the deposit facility and marginal lending facility at 0.75% and 1.75% respectively (slide 7). At the same time, we have introduced a number of non-standard monetary policy measures, with the aim to support credit flows from banks and thereby ensure that our interest rate is transmitted properly to households and firms. Notably, the design of these measures has taken into account the pivotal role of banks in financing the real economy of the euro area  2  BIS central bankers’ speeches  \n",
       "(slide 8). They focused on a proper functioning of the banking sector, by ensuring that funding markets, notably the money market, continued functioning. The main non-standard monetary policy measure in that context is the full allotment of liquidity demand by banks, at fixed, low rates, against eligible collateral. In addition, the ECB also engaged in buying government securities via its Securities Markets Programme (SMP). The Governing Council’s aim of this programme is to restore a proper transmission process that threatened to become impaired given dysfunctional market segments, as witnessed by very high interest rate spreads on sovereign bonds (slide 9). This is a major difference with quantitative easing in other major countries where such bond purchases are conducted in financing governments and against the background of official interest rates being close to the lower zero bound. The aim of quantitative easing is to have a more accommodative monetary policy stance via lowering long-term interest rates. By contrast, the ECB’s purchases of bonds aim to ensure that our official short-term interest rates are transmitted in a proper way to the economy. Another difference is that the ECB fully sterilises the liquidity injected in the market through its SMP while this is not the case in the US and the UK. The ECB has much less government securities on its balance sheet than the central banks of the US and the UK (slide 10). To be fair, this difference not only reflects the quantitative easing policy conducted in the UK and the US. In the US, for instance, government bonds already were an important item on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve before the crisis. The Federal Reserve typically implements its monetary policy through purchases and sales of government bonds. Let me also emphasise that all the non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the ECB are temporary in nature and complementary, rather than supplementary, to our interest rate instrument. At the same time, we should not forget the adverse side-effects of interest rates being kept at very low levels for a long time. In fact, the period preceding the start of the financial market tensions in August 2007 is reminiscent of the associated risks. Notably, the very low level of global interest rates after 2001 and the resulting ample liquidity conditions at the global level has laid the basis for the current crisis. In addition, maintaining very low interests rates for a protracted period may weaken the financial incentive for deleveraging for both the banking and non-financial sectors, and can result in “evergreening” of outstanding loans. Very low interest rates may also discourage banks from trading in interbank money markets. This is an important market for the transmission of monetary policy. Related, it has adverse effects on some financial institutions such as money market funds. Overall, the combination of standard and non-standard monetary policy measures has been successful in maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, while ensuring the transmission of monetary policy in difficult times. This is witnessed by fairly stable inflation expectations around ECB’s objective (slide 11). The ECB therefore has delivered fully on its mandate. Unfortunately, that cannot be said of all policymakers involved, resulting in the lingering of the sovereign debt crisis. To tackle the crisis decisively first and foremost requires tackling its root cause will require ambitious fiscal policies and structural reforms. Fiscal policy Let me now turn to the fiscal situation in the euro area in more detail. The severe imbalances that came to the forefront in the wake of the financial and economic crisis – to a significant extent – are related to past policy mistakes. In this context, one needs to bear in mind that the euro area neither constitutes a fully-fledged federation nor a political or fiscal union. While monetary policy is centralised, budgetary sovereignty remains to a large extent at the Member State level. The Stability and Growth Pact has been put in place to ensure a sufficient degree of fiscal coordination. However, this rules-based framework, which is built  BIS central bankers’ speeches  3  \n",
       "on peer-pressure, was not sufficient to ensure a smooth functioning of the monetary union. This calls for a more pronounced transfer of sovereignty to the European level and the move towards a fiscal union. Countries have joined the euro area and benefited from its advantages but some have failed to live up to the responsibilities that are inherent in being part of a monetary union. In particular, many euro area countries failed to achieve sufficiently sound fiscal positions in line with the rules of the European Fiscal Framework in previous economic good times. This was the consequence of a lax enforcement of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, notably due to a deficient governance framework at the European level. As a result, many countries already entered the crisis with weak fiscal positions which amplified the fiscal deterioration. In 2010, the aggregate fiscal balance of the euro area stood at more than 6% of GDP up from an almost balanced budget in 2000; euro area debt amounted to more than 85% of GDP in 2010. Moreover, 14 out of 17 euro area countries are currently facing an excessive deficit procedure related to a budgetary deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value of the Treaty. Particularly high deficits exist in the countries subject to EU/IMF programmes, i.e. in Ireland, Greece and Portugal, but also in some large euro area countries, notably Spain and France. As consequence, sizeable and persistent structural adjustment will be necessary in most euro area countries to put debt back on a declining path and reduce it to a sustainable level, in line with the 60% of GDP debt criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact. However, most advanced economies face substantial fiscal consolidation requirements. Notably, for the US, the IMF estimates that general government gross debt will reach 100% of GDP in 2011 and that it will continue to rise through the year 2016. At the same time, the general government deficit is expected to remain close to 10% of GDP in 2011 (slide 12). As you can see from the slide, significant aggregate structural adjustment of 1 percentagepoint of GDP per year will be necessary in the euro area to reduce the debt ratio to below 60% of GDP by 2030. For the US, even such a relatively ambitious adjustment path would keep the debt-to-GDP at around 75% of GDP by 2030. These scenarios highlight the significant fiscal challenges we are facing on both sides of the Atlantic in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis. In European countries, the correction of excessive deficits is on its way. The pace of fiscal adjustment has been set by the European Council in a way that reflects country-specific imbalances. Most countries will have to reduce their deficit ratio to below 3% of GDP by 2013 at the latest. Accordingly, euro area Member States have presented medium-term consolidation strategies in their Stability Programmes which point to a strongly expenditurebased adjustment. Such an approach is warranted in view of strong increases in government spending during the crisis in most countries. Moreover, past experience suggests that successful consolidations typically have a strong expenditure component. In addition, case study evidence from previous consolidation episodes indicates that ambitious expenditure reform was typically carried out in the context of a broader economic reform programmes, comprising structural reforms to promote potential growth and institutional reform, e.g. to strengthen the budgetary framework. In fact, many euro area countries, notably the ones subject to EU/IMF programmes, are following such a strategy which I would like to call the European approach to fiscal adjustment. If effectively implemented, such reform programmes would enable countries to address their sustainability risks and, at the same time, limit potential short-term costs of fiscal tightening through growth-enhancing structural reform. Especially in the current environment of heightened market sensitivity, ambitious reform efforts should quickly trigger positive confidence effects and be conducive to macroeconomic stabilisation. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that European governments implement the announced fiscal consolidation and reform measures and ensure – by all means – the  4  BIS central bankers’ speeches  \n",
       "delivery of agreed fiscal targets. This will be crucial to regain market confidence, notably in countries with very high and strongly rising debt ratios and pronounced risks related to the expected ageing-related fiscal burden. For these countries, with a view to ensuring a sufficiently swift return to sound and sustainable fiscal positions, it appears to be advisable to implement fiscal adjustment beyond what is required to correct excessive deficits and converge towards the medium-term budgetary objective, typically a balanced budget. Only if national governments strictly adhere to ambitious fiscal consolidation and reform does it make sense to seek ways to buy some time to implement the planned measures. The European Financial Stability Facility is the appropriate vehicle for that but before coming operational European governments need to deliver on their commitment to leverage funds available to this facility. Public programmes should be based on strong conditionality, as otherwise incentives to take the necessary national measures would be weakened. In addition, surveillance mechanisms at the European level need to be strengthened to monitor progress and avoid major derailments in the future. Decision-making in crisis times is different in our democratic systems. In the US, a mediumterm fiscal exit strategy has yet to be clearly specified. The bipartisan congressional committee on deficit reduction did not reach an agreement on measures to reduce the public deficit. At the same time, the recent downgrade of US long-term government debt and rising sovereign CDS spreads signal that no advanced economy is immune to a loss of market confidence in its public finances. It is therefore essential for the US to formulate a credible fiscal consolidation programme that returns its government debt to a declining path towards sustainable levels. Structural reforms As I mentioned before, deteriorating competitiveness positions in some euro area countries contributed to the current crisis. These countries therefore need to restore price and cost competitiveness. Apart from labour cost moderation, this calls for structural reforms targeted at removing remaining rigidities in labour and product markets, thereby raising potential economic growth. The measures should focus on enhancing wage flexibility and increasing competition in product markets, particularly in services. However, the need for structural reform does not stop with the euro area countries hit most by the sovereign debt crisis. For instance, the US economy would benefit from a more sustainable growth model, where solid and medium-term oriented economic policies strengthen potential growth and job creation. This would include structural reforms that address weaknesses in the labour market and in particular reduce long-term unemployment. Policies that stabilise the housing market, such as facilitating refinancing of mortgage debt, would also help households to deleverage and support private consumption in the medium term. Sustainable growth is also enhanced by policies that avoid the build-up of excessive misalignments in asset prices. At a global level, continuing imbalances require ongoing efforts to address factors or policies that foster disequilibrium flows around the globe. Enhancing exchange rate flexibility in emerging economies with large external surpluses would mitigate the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. Conclusion The lingering and expanding sovereign debt crisis must be halted to avoid macroeconomic and financial disaster, in the euro area and beyond. No country is immune anymore to a loss of market confidence in its public finances. With fiscal imbalances and deteriorating competitiveness in euro area countries at the root of the current crisis, there can in my view be no discussion which policymakers should make a move. Ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reforms by national governments in the euro area are required now – or actually, yesterday.

the European Central Bank, at the 30th edition of the workshop \"The Outlook for the Economy and Finance\", Villa d'Este, Cernobbio, 6 April 2019. * * * To increase competitiveness is the main driver for higher potential growth. Member states have to pursue politics and establish institutions that stimulate the dynamics of a competitive private sector. In most euro area countries potential growth has remained too low, however. Labour market rigidities and inefficient business environment conditions seem to be major impediments. In particular, labour supply is held back by policies which do not sufficiently motivate to take up jobs and do not tackle skill mismatch or labour shortages. Moreover, investment could be strengthened through fostering competition, improve the business environment and reduce uncertainty e.g. through improving the quality and efficiency of public institutions more generally. Despite favourable economic and financing conditions, structural reform progress has been rather limited, including in several of the weakest countries. The trend of insufficient structural reform implementation observed in particular since 2014 has continued during the last year. Only a few countries have engaged in more far-reaching structural reforms, most notably Greece and France. Some countries even reversed recent reforms that had been designed to improve the smooth functioning of the economy, most notably in the areas of labour markets and pension systems. Overall, reform efforts were not in line with reform needs. These policy areas concern national competencies, but in a single markets cross-border spillover effects are generated. Governments therefore need to act at national levels, enhanced through procedures, rules and harmonization at EU level. Against the background of limited reform effort and in spite of the robust cyclical upswing, overall risks and vulnerabilities in many cases have only moderately declined since last year. The Commission’s annual assessment of country specific recommended reforms finds only limited progress.1 The progress made is evaluated using five categories: “no progress”, “limited progress”, “some progress”, “substantial progress” and “full implementation”. “No progress” means that the Member State concerned did not even “credibly announce” measures that would aim to address the policy recommendation. Out of 73 country specific recommendations (CSRs), none saw full implementation, and substantial progress was made in only two cases. For the overwhelming majority of CSRs (more than 90%), the Commission found that Member States made at best some or limited progress. On two CSRs, no progress was made. Most concerning, despite being very vulnerable, the countries experiencing excessive imbalances did not make significantly more reform progress during the last year than the EU average. The same is true for the countries experiencing imbalances. Overall, progress on reforms this year was as weak as last year.

The European Commission presented a set of action points to strengthen the euro’s global role. More recently, the COM has underscored the increasing relevance of capital markets union in supporting the international role of the euro amid geopolitical changes (e.g. Brexit and US foreign and trade policy). To this end, the euro should become even more compelling as a means of payment and a trustworthy investment currency. Without prejudice to the ECB’s independence, we took note of the Commission’s support for our initiatives on market infrastructure and payments, which help to increase efficiency and financial market integration in the euro area.  International trade It was important to resist, the temptation to gain competitive advantage or create national champions by tilting the system in one’s favour (e.g. in the area of tax, privacy, cyber security and fintech policies). The costs of fragmentation of global trade would be high. IMF staff simulations of a global trading system that had been fragmented into three trading blocs show that in such a scenario, each of the blocs was overall worse off, although individual countries within the bloc may actually gain. These issues would also apply to other areas like the international flow of data and access to the global payments system. There are five dimensions where progress is needed: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.  consensus on how to address social and economic grievances; a rethinking of the appropriate mix of domestic policies; strengthening and updating of the international rules of the game; adequate management of global public goods; securing the global financial safety net.  Payments systems The ECB’s responsibility for promoting the smooth operation of payment systems indirectly supports the international standing of the euro. The Eurosystem has contributed to reshaping and consolidating the infrastructure for large-value payments, for post-trading services for financial instruments and, most recently, for instant retail payments. Over the next two or three years we aim at taking measures to consolidate TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities (T2S ), in particular by delivering a centralised liquidity management function; developing a single collateral management system that will be capable of managing the assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations for all euro area countries.  Harmonization agenda More harmonization is necessary to achieve a safe and efficient European post trade landscape. The European Post Trade Forum (EPTF) Report identifies barriers which have not yet been dismantled (formerly known as “Giovannini Barriers”), as well as new bottlenecks which need to be addressed to promote more efficient and resilient market infrastructures in the EU. These include: 2/3  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

The recently agreed proposal (December 2018) is a minimum harmonization directive allowing member states to go further when transposing the rules into national law.  European issuance An important element in a well-functioning capital market is the smooth interplay between issuance on the primary market, investors and secondary markets. In Europe, the issuance and distribution of securities is still complex and operational cost are elevated. Securities are still issued along different national rules, standards and habits. Central Securities Depositories (CSD) play a pivotal role in this process. Today, issuers usually issue in one CSD. All other CSDs, and their national customer base, need to access these securities by connecting to this initial one. This chopped-up process is complex and relatively expensive. Investors and issuers alike see scope for improvements. 1 The progress made is evaluated using five categories: “no progress”, “limited progress”, “some progress”,  “substantial progress” and “full implementation”. “No progress” means that the Member State concerned did not even “credibly announce” measures that would aim to address the policy recommendation.  3/3  BIS central bankers' speeches  \n",

                             6 June 2023\\nCompared with March 2023:\\nconsumer inflation expectations decreased significantly – reversing most of the increases seen in the previous month;\\nexpectations declined for both nominal income growth and nominal spending growth over the next 12 months;\\nexpectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;\\nconsumers expect lower growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead declined.\\nInflation\\nThe median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.9% in April 2023, from 9.9% in March. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased to 4.1% in April, from 5.0% in March, and those for inflation three years ahead decreased to 2.5%, from 2.9% in March. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead also decreased. Thus, the increases observed in March have largely been reversed. Inflation expectations, particularly at the three-year horizon, remained well below the perceived past inflation rate. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations and sharper declines than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)\\nIncome and consumption\\nConsumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to rise more slowly, by 1.1%, compared with 1.3% in March. The decline in expected nominal income growth was concentrated in the first four quintiles of the income distribution – consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile were on average unchanged. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable compared with March, at 7.0%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months reverted close to February’s value, falling to 3.8% in April from 4.1% in March. Developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending growth continued to be broadly aligned across age classes. (Income and consumption results)\\nLabour market and economic growth\\nEconomic growth expectations for the next 12 months were less negative in April, standing at -0.8% compared with -1.0% in March. In line with expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.2% in April, from 11.7% in March. Consumers expected the future unemployment rate to remain higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.0%), but the gap had narrowed to some extent. Quarterly data show that in April 2023 unemployed respondents reported their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months had fallen to 26.6%, from 28.1% in January 2023. Employed respondents reported that their expected probability of losing their job over the next three months had decreased to 7.8% in April, from 8.1% in January. (Labour market and economic growth results)\\nHousing and credit access\\nIn April consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.2% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported for two years – compared with 2.7% in March. The decline in expectations was broad-based across age and income classes. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged down to 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened compared with March, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months remained unchanged from March. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.4% in April from 13.6% in January 2023. This reflects a fall in new credit applications reported by younger respondents, which was partly compensated for by a rise in those reported by older respondents (aged above 34).

                     22 July 2022\\nHICP inflation expectations revised up across all horizons\\nReal GDP growth expectations revised down for the nearer term, but otherwise broadly stable\\nUnemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons\\nIn the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2022, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for all horizons. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, these stand at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% respectively, 1.3, 1.2 and 0.2 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions mainly reflect higher energy and food prices, but also the stronger than expected pass-through of input cost increases. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood at 2.2% on average, revised up by another 0.1 percentage point.\\nReal GDP growth expectations were revised down from the second quarter of 2022 onwards, as well as for 2023, but remained the same for 2024. Longer-term growth expectations were revised up marginally. Respondents noted that the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter of 2022 largely offset the weaker dynamics expected for the other quarters. They report that the main factors contributing to this bleaker growth outlook include intensifying energy price pressures, the tightening of monetary policy around the world and the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of households. They noted that although the supply chain bottlenecks linked to the COVID-19 crisis have eased somewhat, they are still acting as a drag on the global economy. By contrast, fiscal measures against rising energy prices have cushioned the energy price shock to some extent, and the effects of the reopening of the economy have also played out positively.\\nNotwithstanding the downward revisions to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were again revised down for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.7% in 2022 to 6.4% by 2027.

speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), at the 9th Munich Economic Summit, Munich, 29 April 2010. *  *  *  Sehr geehrter Herr Bundespräsident, lieber Horst Köhler, Sehr geehrter Herr Chrobog, sehr geehrter Professor Sinn, Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren, ich danke den Veranstaltern dieser Konferenz recht herzlich für die Einladung. Besonders dankbar bin ich für die Gelegenheit, im Anschluss an meinen langjährigen Freund Horst Köhler sprechen zu dürfen. Wir sind uns über einen langen Zeitraum hinweg in verschiedenen Positionen immer wieder begegnet und haben oft sehr eng zusammengearbeitet. It has always been an enormous pleasure to talk with him and to work with him. Both of us were engaged in the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty. That is where we met nearly twenty years ago. We were also heavily involved with the handling of the European Monetary System crisis in 1992/93. I remember that episode very well. It was a defining moment not only for the monetary integration of Europe. It remains in our memories as a vivid example of what close and friendly cooperation can do in very exceptional and demanding circumstances. In my remarks today I would first like to reflect on the lessons that I believe we can draw from today’s financial and economic crisis. In the second part, I will touch on the current situation, and describe the three key steps that I believe we need to take to return to the path of economic stability. Lessons of the financial crisis The financial crisis has taught us painful lessons. It has revealed fundamental weaknesses in our global financial system. In the years that led up to the crisis, the European Central Bank was among those institutions that warned against the under-pricing of risk in financial markets. But the growing complexity of the global financial system and specifically its international linkages made it difficult to predict how and when developments would turn. With hindsight we know a great deal about the causes of the crisis. Financial innovation led to the development of new instruments that were intended to expand the diversification of risk for savers and investors. In retrospect, we know that instead they contributed to a common exposure to systemic risk. Gradually, the focus of finance shifted in the recent past. From its traditional role of helping the real economy to cope with economic risk, finance became a self-referential activity. The notion of “financial engineering” is a striking illustration of the shift of attitudes that spearheaded the changing focus of finance. When I started my professional career, no one would have used this expression. Engineering is about building tangible structures that support human endeavours. Some of the structures that were invented in finance turned out to be neither tangible nor helpful to society. Nevertheless, the vast expansion of the financial sector would not have been possible without both supportive macroeconomic conditions and inadequate prudential regulation. Global current account imbalances have generated large financial flows, as large developed countries sucked in massive capital flows from oil exporting and emerging economies.

       "Seemingly bright macroeconomic prospects combined with deregulation and global conditions of over-extended credit. The crisis has shown that deregulation does not always pave the way for greater efficiency and greater prosperity. Rather we have rediscovered the value of properly functioning regulatory and supervisory institutions. And we have also rediscovered the value of mediumterm orientation, sustainability and stability. Consequences of the financial crisis The consequences to be drawn to minimise the risk of a comparable crisis in the future are numerous and wide-ranging. First, comprehensive regulatory reforms of the financial system have to be implemented with top priority. While some progress has been already made, major challenges lie ahead. Most importantly, the pro-cyclicality of the financial system must be mitigated. It is essential to change regulatory and accounting rules that tend to amplify the natural cyclical swings of our economies. Second, we have to enhance the transparency of financial structures. That concerns rules of disclosure as well as market infrastructure. In particular, derivative market instruments need to be subject to greater transparency. But, beyond changes in financial governance, there needs to be a deeper economic assessment of the benefits of these structures to society. Third, incentives should be aligned. Remuneration schemes, for example, should support sustainable business rather than myopic trading. There is one over-arching issue that I would like to highlight: the financial industry has to reconsider its role in the economy. Returning to a role of serving the real economy would be desirable. “Financial engineers” may prefer to create ever more “sophisticated” financial products. But finance has to come back to the basics. Among the basic tasks of the financial industry is the supply of credit to the real economy. This too is a profitable business, the profits from which are justified because they are mirrored by the social value of the intermediation function. Businesses and individuals depend in particular on the steady supply of credit by banks. The ECB and the national central banks of the euro area have taken comprehensive measures during the crisis to help commercial banks and other financial institutions. When the turbulence started in August 2007, the ECB was the first central bank to step in by frontloading liquidity. After the intensification of the crisis in the autumn of 2008, we tackled the paralysis of interbank transactions in the money market. In addition to a swift and substantial reduction of our policy rate, in line with our primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term, we decided to implement a set of non-standard measures, which we collectively refer to as “enhanced credit support”. I explained these measures in detail here in Munich in a speech last July. These measures have significantly helped to maintain banks’ liquidity. But we did not pursue this policy with the ultimate goal of reconstructing banks’ profitability. Rather, the purpose of our enhanced credit support has been to ensure the transmission of monetary policy transactions to the broader economy. Global economic governance The crisis has important implications for economic governance, and here remarkable efforts have been made or are under way. On the global level, the G20 has become the main forum for international cooperation, and a strong consensus has emerged within this group not only  2  BIS Review 59/2010  \n",
       "about the causes of the crisis but also about the appropriate policy responses. The G20 has been highly effective in addressing the global crisis. The more technical questions concerning regulation and financial stability are mainly delegated to the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The extension of both the membership and the range of tasks of the previous Financial Stability Forum have pushed the Financial Stability Board into a leading role when it comes to coordinating the reform of financial regulation. The European regulatory response to the crisis will include a new body that will provide macroprudential oversight and focus on the avoidance of systemic risk in the financial system of the European Union as a whole. This is the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the establishment of which intends to make macro-prudential oversight operational at the European level. While the ECB and the national central banks of the European Union will be heavily involved in the ESRB framework, it is essential to make a clear separation between macro-prudential oversight and monetary policy. The primary objective of euro area monetary policy will remain the maintenance of price stability. Financial stability lays the conditions for the central bank to pursue its task of maintaining stable prices. It is also the outcome of an environment of steady macroeconomic prospects and confidence, which only stable prices can ensure. Current challenges for European integration Ladies and gentlemen, although the financial crisis did not originate here, it has profoundly challenged the European economy – and it is continuing to do so. Economic and Monetary Union – in short: EMU – is a union based on two foundations: economic and monetary. These are two foundations that reinforce one another. Responsibility for the “M” is centralised and assigned to the Eurosystem with the ECB at its core, aiming to ensure price stability in the euro area over the medium term. We have defined price stability as an average annual inflation rate below but close to 2% over the medium term. How have we performed against this objective since the introduction of the euro? Based on current staff projections for this year, by the end of 2010, the average inflation rate in the euro area since the introduction of the euro is estimated to be around 1.95%. Beyond the ups and downs of the economic cycle since 1999, despite the swings in the international prices of raw materials, monetary policy has managed to keep its inflation record faithful to its strategic aim. I am satisfied that we have fulfilled our mandate. Speaking in Germany, I would like to recall that the average annual inflation rate in this country in the 1990s was 2.2%, and in the 1980s it was 2.9%. Given the initial promise made to all people of Europe that the euro would be as credible, reliable and as good a store of value as were the best of the national currencies. On these figures, I can say that with an estimated average annual inflation rate of 1.95% for the first twelve years, the euro is in terms of safeguarding purchasing power “stark wie die D-Mark”. In a nutshell, the “M” has done its part. The main current challenges for our union originate in the “E”. Economic union is based on responsible national policies: fiscal policies, wage policies, structural policies. At the core of the economic union is the Stability and Growth Pact. The crisis has revealed some of the shortcomings of national policies to comply with the requirements of an economic union. In particular, in a number of cases, national policies that  BIS Review 59/2010  3  \n",
       "are responsible for domestic public finances and for the competitiveness of member economies have not achieved their objectives. But the crisis has also revealed weaknesses in the peer surveillance process and in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. Thus another major lesson of the crisis is the need to strengthen the institutional framework of the economic union. Of course, the deterioration of public budgets has partly been due to a “migration” of risk from the financial sector to the public sector. Public budgets have been called on to absorb the excessive risk that the financial industry had been creating during the booming years that led up to the crisis. Partly, however, the deterioration of public budgets is also due to some short-sighted fiscal and economic decisions in the brighter times that preceded the crisis. Before the crisis, weak public finances had combined in some countries with inattention to domestic competitiveness and a lack of long-term strategies to prepare national economies for competing successfully in the challenging – but rewarding – environment of the internal market. In Greece, in particular, past fiscal irresponsibility and inattentiveness to domestic competitiveness made the national economy extraordinarily vulnerable to a sudden turn in confidence. As I have implied, after the crisis, the main players in the world economy will be judged by a new yardstick. Private players will be held accountable to new and stricter standards of economic integrity and prudent management. And governments, the world over – and in Europe in particular – will have to show self-discipline and trustworthiness to gain respect and preserve confidence. That is why financial reform will have to go hand in hand with fiscal reform. Fiscal reform will reinforce confidence. In the current situation, we have to – and we do – stand firm on these principles. Speculation on more and more elevated sovereign risk has been one factor behind spreads being driven to very high levels. This is why it was very important that the heads of state and government declared on 11 February 2010 that they were ready to “take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole”. I said, on behalf of the ECB, that I approved of this important statement. In this respect let me stress the following: Loans are not transfers, and loans come at a cost. They come not only at a financial cost; they also come with a strict conditionality. This conditionality needs to give assurance to lenders, not only that they will be repaid but also that the borrower will be able to stand on its own feet over a multi-year horizon. In the case of Greece, this will require courageous, recognisable and specific actions by the Greek government that will lastingly and credibly consolidate the public budget. Other countries in the Union and elsewhere have gone through times that were no less difficult, and they have emerged from a determined adjustment stronger and more competitive than in the past. These countries have demonstrated that a clear U-turn in national policy governance is achievable. After making the turn, they have reaped large payoffs. I will not comment on the negotiations that are currently taking place in Athens. They have to be concluded by a courageous, comprehensive and convincing multi-year programme. And I am confident as regards the results of these discussions between the Greek government, the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Let me add a word about Germany and the current public debate here. I very much appreciated the invitation by Finance Minister Schäuble yesterday to speak with the floor leaders of all political parties represented in the Bundestag. I said yesterday in Berlin that I had found this meeting – in which Jürgen Stark and I could respond to all questions of our  4  BIS Review 59/2010  \n",
       "interlocutors – extremely important. My main message was that a fast parliamentary procedure was highly recommended in the present circumstances. What we need most at this time is a strong sense of direction. We need a sense of direction that can guide us on how we can emerge from these turbulent events and how we can return to the path of economic stability. In my view, this sense of direction can be provided in three steps: first, in the case of Greece, a strong and credible programme, negotiated between the Commission, the ECB, IMF and the Greek government. Second, the support I have mentioned that will avoid the materialisation of financial risks for the euro area as a whole. And third, a giant step forward in our own framework of surveillance, peer pressure and policy adjustment within the monetary union. Speaking in the presence of Federal President Köhler, who played such a decisive role in creating monetary union and in the presence of the former Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the father of the Stability and Growth Pact, I must say that I count on the contribution of Germany with regard to the third step – the leap forward in policy surveillance and policy adjustment. Fiscal adjustment alone will not be sufficient to ensure sustainability. Structural reforms that will lead to more balanced growth are also vital to rebuild the resilience of our economies. The result must therefore be a renewal of the Stability and Growth Pact and the incorporation of a framework of surveillance for national policies of competitiveness. I hope that considerable energy will be devoted to this area in this country, so that a central outcome of the present demanding episode will be to strengthen the foundations of our monetary union. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has reacted with speed, energy and determination in the financial crisis. We have to stay on this path. We continue to need wise and sound, rapid and determined action by all countries. We need to resolutely improve the effectiveness of the peers’ surveillance of fiscal and economic policies. The weak points of past multilateral surveillance will be corrected, and the Stability and Growth Pact will be reinforced and rigorously applied in its letter and in its spirit. It has to spot at an early stage and to correct deviant behaviours. The overall scope of peers’ surveillance should be resolutely broadened to include the competitiveness as well as structural reforms of individual countries, so as to maintain healthy and sustainable growth as the ECB has constantly asked for during the past year. In doing so we will pave the way for a European economy which will have a higher level of growth potential, and which will be prosperous, stable and resilient. The introduction of the single currency represents the greatest achievement to date in the history of European integration – a process that has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe. Countries that share a common currency share a common destiny. Thank you for your attention.  BIS Review 59/2010  5  \n",

       "433   Jean-Claude Trichet: Reflections on the global financial system Keynote speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the 2007 25th Anniversary IIF Annual Membership Meeting, Washington DC, 20 October 2007. * I.  *  *  Introduction  It is a great pleasure to be here on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary IIF Annual Membership Meeting. During the last quarter of a century, the Institute has proved to be both an important coordination forum for the international financial industry and a counterpart to international financial institutions and fora, making many valuable contributions to the international dialogue on the global financial system. Back in 1983 when the Institute was founded – in response to the international debt crisis – one of its key jobs was to provide its members with information about the policies and performance of borrowing countries. As time passed by, the range of the Institute’s activities broadened and it has worked as well on such issues as global financial regulation. Moreover, it played an active role during the last number of years in the debate about the international financial architecture and emerging market policy issues. Celebrating today’s anniversary brings to mind not only the many policy issues that we discussed over the past 25 years but also the many colleagues and friends from all parts of the world whose professional careers are in various ways linked to the development of the international financial system and to the issues that the Institute has been dealing with. I myself have interacted with the IIF on many occasions, not only back in the 1980s when I was chairman of the Paris Club, but also thereafter in my capacity as governor of the Banque de France and today as President of the European Central Bank. In my talk today, I will seize the opportunity of the 25th anniversary of the Institute and share with you some thoughts on two broad issues that I deem particularly relevant. First, I will recall the past financial crises that have hit emerging market countries over the last two and a half decades and focus on the progress that has been achieved with regard to devising mechanisms for crisis prevention and crisis containment. Second, I will take a closer look at the recent turmoil in financial markets and provide some preliminary reflections. II.  Emerging market countries and their access to international financial markets  The financial integration of countries into the global economy continues at a high pace. While advanced countries are the most financially integrated, emerging market countries have significantly increased their cross border asset and liabilities positions and hence improve their degree of integration. The tremendous benefits that are associated with this integration process in terms of rising living standards and overall prosperity should not be taken for granted though since globalisation and rising capital mobility require taking into account the possibility of shocks spilling over into different countries. The financial crises that we have witnessed over the last 25 years and that were largely confined to emerging market and developing countries have not been few: The debt crises during the 1980s that started with Poland and Mexico and spread to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union; some years later, the Mexican crisis in 1994; the Asian crisis starting in 1997; the Russian crisis in 1998; and the Argentinian crisis in 2001-02. As is well known, the composition of private capital flows to emerging market and developing countries in the periods before and after the crisis of the 1980s differed substantially. Looking at World Bank Global Development Finance data, from the 1973 oil price shock until the 1982 Mexican crisis bank lending amounted to almost two thirds of overall private capital flows, dwarfing bond financing and equity flows, which stood at below 5 percent and 17  BIS Review 119/2007  1  \n",
       "percent respectively. This composition of private capital flows changed dramatically in the 1990s. In the period between 1990 and 1997, while bank lending made up only 12 percent, FDI and portfolio equity flows as well as bond financing combined had risen to an impressive 80 percent of overall private capital inflows. In hindsight, the 1989 Brady Plan of collateralized debt reduction could be seen as paramount in paving the way for these significant changes. That said, and irrespective of whether the crisis took place in the 1980s or 1990s, all of these crises have in common that they not only imposed major macroeconomic costs on emerging market countries and led to significant financial losses on the part of commercial banks and bond holders in mature economies. These events posed also major threats to the international financial system. What is important to note, though, is that the international community managed to resolve all of these crises. This was so because the international institutions and forums that are charged with crisis resolution were up to their responsibilities. Moreover, measures were taken by sovereigns in emerging market countries and the private sector in mature economies to fight these crises. Going forward, an important lesson that we have learned from these events is that our efforts aimed to strengthen the global financial architecture need to continue tirelessly to ensure that the resilience of the global financial system is preserved. Updating the effectiveness of this architecture in the areas of crisis prevention and crisis management is an ongoing task, and many crucial steps have been taken, and are being taken, to this end. Over the last number of years, it has of course been the preventive rather than the resolving mechanisms that have been more relevant. In this respect I would like to focus not so much on the various institutional adjustments of the international financial architecture, but concentrate on a subject that I deem particularly relevant, namely the development and implementation of international financial standards and codes. Such tools, which set out widely accepted good principles, practices, rules and guidelines, determine the interaction between public policy and market functioning. They serve as effective mechanisms for crisis prevention and crisis containment and hence do deserve a closer look. Following the Asian crisis, the need to strengthen the international financial architecture was widely recognized. A major initiative was clearly the creation of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in 1999 and its work on developing and implementing financial standards and codes. Most relevant are the 12 standards that the FSF has designated as key to strengthening and preserving the soundness of financial systems and that cover a broad range of subject areas. These standards pertain to macroeconomic policy and transparency, institutional and market infrastructure as well as financial regulation and supervision. As far as creation and implementation of these standards is concerned, many international institutions and fora have been involved, including the G20, the Basel-based committees, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and the International Financial Institutions. The progress that has been made over the last number of years is truly impressive. For example, as of today, three quarters of the Fund membership has completed more than 840 modules of the IMF’s Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes, the so-called ROSCs. Moreover, more than a third of the IMF’s member countries subscribe to its special standard for dissemination of economic and financial data, the SDDS. Finally, more than 60 percent of the Fund membership has so far completed a Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP). That said, further improvements should be sought in respect of participation rates, including also as regards the reporting to the IMF on the currency composition of countries’ foreign exchange reserves. Why does the implementation of internationally agreed standards and codes play such an important role when it comes to the prevention of financial crises? There are a number of benefits that bear emphasis. At the national level, these tools do not only help anchor market expectations as they make more predictable future macroeconomic and financial policy  2  BIS Review 119/2007  \n",
       "measures. They also make institutions, markets, infrastructure and policies more transparent, thus mitigating the risks of disruptive developments. Moreover, international financial stability is promoted and the risks of financial distress are curbed through betterinformed lending and investment decisions. In passing, I would also note the more widespread use of market-based policy frameworks in many countries that has been highly conducive to preventing financial crises. Another consideration that deserves emphasis is that standards and codes do not necessarily have to be set and enforced solely by public authorities. Rather, the private sector in many instances plays an important role, and rightly so. Indeed, there can be no doubt that ensuring transparency and an appropriate flow of information is the responsibility of both the public and the private sector. One example of private sector involvement in the area of international standards relates to accounting and auditing where private sector organisations are the issuing bodies. Another prominent example – one that relates directly to the work of the IIF – are the “Principles for stable capital flows and debt restructuring in emerging markets”, on which I will now elaborate in more detail. The Principles, which have been agreed between sovereign debtors and their private creditors, serve a number of important purposes. They aim to foster transparency and the timely flow of information between debtors and creditors. Moreover, they seek to ensure close debtor-creditor dialogue and cooperation to avoid restructuring. In cases where a debt restructuring becomes inevitable, the Principles request relevant parties to pursue good faith actions and call for fair treatment of affected creditors. With regard to the creation of the Principles, I remember launching the idea at a luncheon organised by the Bretton Woods Committee in 2001. What was important then, and is of course today, is the clear support that the Principles received from private sector representatives as well as public officials of the issuing countries. Indeed, the work that has been done by the IIF in this area and its backing has been, and continues to be, highly valuable. And I remember that the first mention of the “Principles” in a communiqué of the G20 was made in New Dehli. When it comes to awareness and implementation of the Principles, I am very pleased to see that further progress has been achieved. A rising number of sovereign debtors and international investors have underlined their backing for the Principles and have already applied them. What is the Principles’ formula for success and why is it that commitment to, and compliance with, the Principles is advancing? I believe that the answers to these questions lie in the Principles’ design features. The Principles are not a heavy-handed mandatory approach, but a soft mode of governance: they incorporate strictly voluntary, market-based, and flexible guidelines which are applied on a case-by-case basis. Talking about the market-based approach to avoiding and resolving sovereign debt crises, I should also mention collective action clauses (CACs) that are incorporated into international sovereign bonds. While there was not much enthusiasm for CACs back in 1996 when the G10 Rey report was published, the changing international financial landscape and the experience with the crises of the 1990s led to a fresh look at CACs and ultimately an increasing interest. We all remember well how the Mexican government assumed the role of an icebreaker and in February 2003 announced a bond issue with CACs. Many other countries have followed Mexico’s example, and today CACs are a standard provision in international bonds. As a consequence, the share of outstanding emerging market sovereign bonds including CACs has now reached two third. What is worth underlining, and confirmed by empirical evidence, is that, contrary to earlier concerns, CACs have not significantly affected the price of the bonds or the levels of subscription. In concluding, I would point out that there are many examples of international standards and codes – be they agreed solely by the public sector, jointly by the public and the private sector or by the private sector only – that have proven highly useful as tools for crisis prevention. They are woven into the fabric of the international financial architecture and make an  BIS Review 119/2007  3  \n",
       "important contribution to strengthening the resilience of the international financial system. Finally, what ought to be stressed is that for standards and codes to retain their relevance, policymakers and standard-setters are faced with the constant challenge to ensure that these instruments are mutually consistent and regularly updated so that they are in line with the fast changing global financial environment. III.  Mature economies and the recent turmoil in financial markets  Let me now move from some lessons of past crises in emerging economies to the situation we are now facing in the global financial system. What has been notable about recent experience is that the epicentre of market turbulence has shifted from the emerging economies. This we saw during the bursting of the “dot com bubble” at the beginning of the decade and now, a financial market liquidity squeeze that simultaneously affected many advanced economies was triggered in late July this year. It began with a loss of confidence in the valuations of credit market securities where the underlying assets are US sub-prime mortgages and it quickly spread, causing disruptions in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market and eventually, by way of consequence, in the unsecured inter-bank money markets as concerns mounted about counterparty credit risks. Several markets were affected by the turbulence and the spill-over effects were generally characterised by losses of market liquidity and heightened market volatility. It is important to note that the present significant market correction is not an event that should surprise us. We had been quite clear, since a number of months if not years in stressing a global phenomenon of underpricing of risks which was signaled in particular by a low level of volatility, a low level of spreads, a low level of risk premia across the board in a large array of products and markets. In many respect the present episode can be interpreted as correcting those anomalies and paving the way – once the turbulences would have dissipated – for a more sustainable structure of global finance. That being said even if the likelihood and even the necessity of a market correction was largely recognised by the public as well as the private sector, the channels that were the vehicles for the propagation of the turbulences were not identified ex ante. Several observations can be made in this respect. First, despite the fact that over recent years credit risk transfer has facilitated a widespread sharing of risk in the financial system, the recent market turbulence has nevertheless confirmed pre-existing concerns about the risks stemming from a lack of transparency about where credit risks ultimately reside in the financial system. Paradoxically in a large number of cases the credit risk remained in the realm of the commercial banks through the commitment they still had to activate back up lines of conduits or structured investment vehicles. Second, even if the risks were well dispersed across the system, the recent events have illustrated the importance of adverse selection problems in a crisis situation in that even a suspicion that counterparties could have modest exposures to assets for which no market value can be computed can significantly impair market functioning. Third, the financial market turmoil has highlighted vulnerabilities created by off-balance sheet special investment vehicles set up mostly by banks. Such vehicles have proven to be more prone to liquidity mismatches than anticipated, which, as a result, caused contingent credit lines to be drawn on banks. Finally, the fact that the problems were related to the rolling over of secured short-term financing instruments rather than unsecured instruments highlighted the risks created by excessive reliance on ratings in valuing complex assets which are used as collateral in shortterm asset-backed commercial paper markets. Although some signs of normalisation of credit market conditions emerged throughout September and early October, for global financial institutions the turbulence in the financial  4  BIS Review 119/2007  \n",
       "markets has clearly created some challenges. Many large institutions have been warning that future earnings will be materially affected as a result of both direct and indirect exposures to US sub-prime mortgage securities. Nevertheless, after several years of strong profit growth, capital bases are comfortably in excess of regulatory requirements. As a result, the global financial system – especially the core financial institutions within it – has remained resilient. Looking forward, the uncertainty as to how market liquidity problems will eventually be resolved clearly complicates the assessment of the medium-term outlook for financial stability, both globally and in the euro area. Given the relative strength of the underlying fundamentals – although pockets of vulnerability do exist – the central scenario is that the impact of the financial turbulence on the intermediation of credit is likely to be relatively contained. Nevertheless, low probability but plausible and challenging scenarios for financial stability could be triggered by adverse disturbances that affect global market liquidity conditions or if unanticipated credit events were to occur. Let me draw some further, albeit preliminary, lessons and putting forward tentative suggestions. First, it is important to keep in mind that the recent market liquidity squeeze originated from a surge in defaults by a sub-set of borrowers with particularly weak credit fundamentals. As the global credit cycle advances, one can hope that default rates do not start rising in other parts of the credit markets. We need to monitor the situation closely in order to identify any such adverse spill-over effects. Second, an important factor holding back market liquidity in the credit and money markets at the current juncture seems to be uncertainties about the ultimate holders of assets and derivatives where credit quality has deteriorated. In such an environment, further voluntary disclosure by both banks and non-regulated entities – including conduits, special purpose vehicles, etc – could work as an important signalling mechanism that would allow investors to re-assess positions and gradually help the market for structured finance to start functioning again. Third, for financial institutions, the period ahead is likely to provide a first material test of the effects of changing banking business models to one whereby the securitisation of bank assets and the role of non-bank financial institutions have become increasingly important. Although currently profitable and well capitalised, many banks will experience income and credit losses, which may trigger a re-assessment by some of them of the suitability of this socalled “originate-and-distribute” business model. With regard to hedge funds, they have not been at the centre of the turmoil. An important lesson in this regard is that many funds with solid financing structures and/or strategies geared towards distressed asset management are likely to have prospered from recent events, thereby smoothening volatility and mitigating the effects of a financial de-leveraging process. Finally, certain supervisory and regulatory issues can already be identified as warranting further attention or action. Initiatives are already underway at the European and international level to draw lessons and consider further policy actions. Whilst it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions, there is a common understanding on the need for finding solutions that can be applied consistently at the global level. In this respect, international coordination is of the utmost importance, as any policy action should be applied consistently, thus ensuring a level playing field globally. Turning to possible lessons from a regulatory and supervisory viewpoint, I would stress first of all the importance of effective implementation of Basel II which, despite the possible need for some revisions in light of the recent financial market developments, provides a sound basis for banking supervision and incentives for improvements in banks’ risk management. Second, I would mention three key areas that warrant further attention on the part of the international community. First, banks need to further improve their risk management, in particular liquidity risk management. The complexity of structured finance products calls for  BIS Review 119/2007  5  \n",
       "banks to have in place commensurately sophisticated risk management systems, including liquidity risk stress-testing. Second, the role rating agencies played in the recent events needs to be assessed. In particular, a better insight is needed into the incentive structures, including possible conflicts of interest, to perform proper due diligence. At the same time, the possible lack of incentives for investors to carry out their own credit analysis and due diligence should also be taken into account. Third, certain areas of the regulatory framework may need to be reviewed, such as the treatment of liquidity risk and the securitisation framework, in particular the treatment of liquidity exposures to special purpose vehicles and the assessment of risk transfer, given their significance in the recent financial turbulences. Let me conclude by stressing that I am confident that from this process, an even stronger financial system will emerge, which will be well able to face the future challenges for the global intermediation of credit. IV.  Concluding remarks  One important lesson that we have learned from past financial crises and that should be applied at the current juncture is that fostering transparency proves to be an effective mechanism for both crisis prevention and crisis containment. This is so because ensuring transparency through the appropriate disclosure of information reduces uncertainties on the part of market participants, thus leading to less disruptive market movements and overshooting. Moreover, transparency helps minimise contagion in all compartments of global finance, not least through its preventive, but also dampening, impact on herd behaviour of market participants. Enabling market participants to differentiate across players and to price risks appropriately is therefore a highly valuable outcome. As we have seen, the concept of transparency relates to many different areas such as the domain of sovereign risks and the interaction between sovereign borrowers and their private creditors and investors as well as to financial markets of industrialized countries. While I am firmly convinced that more progress ought to be achieved when it comes to introducing transparency in the various areas of the global financial system, I am equally convinced that we do not need heavy-handed public sector regulation to reach our goals. On the contrary, there are many examples of both self-regulation by the financial industry and joint governance involving both the private and the public sector. One promising recent initiative are the benchmarks for best practices that a number of highly leveraged institutions have worked out voluntarily. Another example that has proven highly successful are the Principles for stable capital flows on which I have elaborated before. In sum, I would underline that it is the task of all the stakeholders of the global financial system, regardless of whether they belong to the private or the public sector, to live up to their respective responsibilities and contribute appropriately to the stability of this system. In this context, the IIF has made very significant and valuable contributions during the last 25 years, and I look forward to its future work.  6  BIS Review 119/2007  \n",

fsf 1999 work developing implementing financial standards codes relevant 12 standards fsf designated key strengthening preserving soundness financial systems cover broad range subject areas standards pertain macroeconomic policy transparency institutional market infrastructure well financial regulation supervision far creation implementation standards concerned many international institutions fora involved including g20 basel based committees financial action task force money laundering international financial institutions progress made last number years truly impressive example today three

thus mitigating risks disruptive developments moreover international financial stability promoted risks financial distress curbed betterinformed lending investment decisions passing would also note widespread use market based policy frameworks many countries highly conducive preventing financial crises another consideration deserves emphasis standards codes necessarily set enforced solely public authorities rather private sector many instances plays important role rightly indeed doubt ensuring transparency appropriate flow information responsibility public private sector one example private sector involvement area international standards relates accounting auditing private sector organisations issuing bodies another prominent example – one relates directly work iif – “principles stable capital flows debt restructuring emerging markets” elaborate detail principles agreed sovereign debtors private creditors serve number important purposes aim foster transparency timely flow

finally ought stressed standards codes retain relevance policymakers standard setters faced constant challenge ensure instruments mutually consistent regularly updated line fast changing global financial environment iii mature economies recent turmoil financial markets let move lessons past crises emerging economies situation facing global financial system notable recent experience epicentre market turbulence shifted emerging economies saw bursting “dot com bubble” beginning decade financial market liquidity squeeze simultaneously affected many advanced economies triggered late july year began loss confidence valuations credit market securities underlying assets us sub prime mortgages quickly spread causing disruptions asset backed commercial paper abcp market eventually way consequence unsecured inter bank money markets concerns mounted counterparty credit risks several markets affected turbulence spill effects generally characterised losses market liquidity heightened market volatility important note present significant market correction event surprise us quite clear since number months years stressing global phenomenon underpricing risks signaled particular low level volatility low level spreads low level risk premia across board large array products markets many respect present episode interpreted correcting anomalies paving way – turbulences would dissipated – sustainable structure global finance said even likelihood even necessity market correction largely recognised public well private sector channels vehicles propagation turbulences identified ex ante several observations made respect first despite fact recent years credit risk transfer facilitated widespread sharing risk financial system recent market turbulence nevertheless confirmed pre existing concerns risks stemming lack transparency credit risks ultimately reside financial system paradoxically large number cases credit risk remained realm commercial banks commitment still activate back lines conduits structured investment vehicles second even risks well dispersed across system recent events illustrated importance adverse selection problems crisis situation even suspicion counterparties could modest exposures assets market value computed significantly impair market functioning third financial market turmoil highlighted vulnerabilities created balance sheet special investment vehicles set mostly banks vehicles proven prone liquidity mismatches anticipated result caused contingent credit lines drawn banks finally fact problems related rolling secured short term financing instruments rather unsecured instruments highlighted risks created excessive reliance ratings valuing complex assets used collateral shortterm asset backed commercial paper markets although signs normalisation credit market conditions emerged throughout september early october global financial institutions turbulence financial 4 bis review 119 2007 markets clearly created challenges many large institutions warning future earnings materially affected result direct indirect exposures us sub prime mortgage securities nevertheless several years strong profit growth capital bases comfortably excess regulatory requirements result global financial system – especially core financial institutions within – remained resilient looking forward uncertainty market liquidity problems eventually resolved clearly complicates assessment medium term outlook financial stability globally euro area given relative strength underlying fundamentals – although pockets vulnerability exist – central scenario impact financial turbulence intermediation credit likely relatively contained nevertheless low probability plausible challenging scenarios financial stability could triggered adverse disturbances affect global market liquidity conditions unanticipated credit events occur let draw albeit preliminary lessons putting forward tentative suggestions first important keep mind recent market liquidity squeeze originated surge defaults sub set borrowers particularly weak credit fundamentals global credit cycle advances one hope default rates start rising parts credit markets need monitor situation closely order identify adverse spill effects second important factor holding back market liquidity credit money markets current juncture seems uncertainties ultimate holders assets derivatives credit quality deteriorated environment voluntary disclosure banks non regulated entities – including conduits special purpose vehicles etc – could work important signalling mechanism would allow investors assess positions gradually help market structured finance start functioning third financial institutions period ahead likely provide first material test effects changing banking business models one whereby securitisation bank assets role non bank financial institutions become increasingly important although currently profitable well capitalised many banks experience income credit losses may trigger assessment suitability socalled “originate distribute” business model regard hedge funds centre turmoil important lesson regard many funds solid financing structures strategies geared towards distressed asset management likely prospered recent events thereby smoothening volatility mitigating effects financial de leveraging process finally certain supervisory regulatory issues already identified warranting attention action initiatives already underway european international level draw lessons consider policy actions whilst still early draw definitive conclusions common understanding need finding solutions applied consistently global level respect international coordination utmost importance policy action applied consistently thus ensuring level playing field globally turning possible lessons regulatory supervisory viewpoint would stress first importance effective implementation basel ii despite possible need revisions light recent financial market developments provides sound basis banking supervision incentives improvements banks’ risk management second would mention three key areas warrant attention part international community first banks need improve risk management particular liquidity risk management complexity structured finance products calls bis review 119 2007 5 banks place commensurately sophisticated risk management systems including liquidity risk stress testing second role rating agencies played recent events needs assessed particular better insight needed incentive structures including possible conflicts interest perform proper due diligence time possible lack incentives investors carry credit analysis due diligence also taken account third certain areas regulatory framework may need reviewed treatment liquidity risk securitisation framework particular treatment liquidity exposures special purpose vehicles assessment risk transfer given significance recent financial turbulences let conclude stressing confident process even stronger financial system emerge well able face future challenges global intermediation credit iv concluding remarks one important lesson learned past financial crises applied current juncture fostering transparency proves effective mechanism crisis prevention crisis containment ensuring transparency appropriate disclosure information reduces uncertainties part market participants thus leading less disruptive market movements overshooting moreover transparency helps minimise contagion compartments global finance least preventive also dampening impact herd behaviour market participants enabling market participants differentiate across players price risks appropriately therefore highly valuable outcome seen concept transparency relates many different areas domain sovereign risks interaction sovereign borrowers private creditors investors well financial markets industrialized countries firmly convinced progress ought achieved comes introducing transparency various areas global financial system equally convinced need heavy handed public sector regulation reach goals contrary many examples self regulation financial industry joint governance involving private public sector one promising recent initiative benchmarks best practices number highly leveraged institutions worked voluntarily another example proven highly
