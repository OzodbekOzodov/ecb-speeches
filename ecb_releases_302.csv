Europa Open Air 2023 celebrates Europe’s diversity in Frankfurt
Over 12,000 guests expected for musical evening on waterfront
On Thursday, 31 August 2023 the European Central Bank (ECB), together with broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk, will once again present the traditional Europa Open Air concert with the Hessischer Rundfunk orchestra, Frankfurt Radio Symphony. The popular concert at Frankfurt’s waterfront location Weseler Werft will allow spectators to enjoy some of Europe’s finest concert pieces, with “celebrating Europe” as the theme. This year the event coincides with the 25th anniversary of the ECB.
“Europa Open Air reflects the ECB’s commitment as a European institution and as a member of the local community. Music, literature and the performing and fine arts know no borders; they allow us to be united in diversity,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The evening will start with a performance by the Frankfurt Radio Big Band, accompanied by soul singer Joy Denalane. Conducted by music director Alain Altinoglu, the Frankfurt Radio Symphony will then present pieces based on musical fairy tales. The event will close with two works featuring Mediterranean rhythms.
The concert will be broadcast live over the internet, and on German TV and radio. Further information (in German) can be found on Hessischer Rundfunk’s website.

Compared with April 2023:
consumer inflation expectations for the next 12 months decreased further, while those for inflation three years ahead remained stable;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased slightly, while expectations for nominal spending growth continued to decline;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expect lower growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.0% in May 2023, from 8.9% in April. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months also decreased to 3.9%, from 4.1% in April, while those for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged at 2.5%. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead fell to its lowest level since March 2022 (after the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine), although it remained above levels observed prior to this. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the three-year horizon. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) still reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to increase by 1.2%, compared with 1.1% in April. The increase in expected nominal income growth was mainly concentrated in the two lowest quintiles of the income distribution, while consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile decreased, on average. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months decreased slightly to 6.8%, from 7.0% in April. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased further to 3.5%, from 3.8% in April and 4.1% in March. The higher income groups reported a sharper drop in expectations for nominal spending growth than the lower two quintiles of the income distribution. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months were slightly less negative, standing at -0.7% compared with -0.8% in April. In line with these less negative expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.0%, from 11.2% in April. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be only slightly higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (10.9%), implying a broadly stable labour market. Consumers in the lowest income quintile reported the largest decline in perceived and expected unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.1% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported in the past two years – compared with 2.2% in April. The decline in expectations was driven by respondents aged 55 to 70 and was broad-based across income categories, with the noticeable exception of the lowest income quintile. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged up to 5.1%, from 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both eased slightly compared with April. (Housing and credit access results)

Credit terms and conditions tightened for all types of counterparty between March and May 2023
Resources and attention dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures to banks and dealers increased
With the exception of domestic government bonds, financing rates/spreads increased for funding secured against all types of collateral
Overall credit terms and conditions in the securities financing and OTC derivatives markets tightened for all types of counterparty between March and May 2023. This was a continuation of the developments observed over the previous eight quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the March 2023 survey. The tightening of credit terms and conditions was most pronounced for banks and dealers and insurance companies. Survey respondents mainly attributed this tightening to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning – and, to a lesser extent, concerns about an expected deterioration in the financial strength of counterparties and reduced competition from other institutions. Respondents expected overall credit terms to tighten further over the period from June to August 2023. Importantly, 40% of respondents reported that the amount of resources and attention dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures to banks and dealers had increased over the review period.

Note: Net percentages are calculated as the difference between the percentage of respondents reporting “tightened somewhat” or “tightened considerably” and the percentage reporting “eased somewhat” or “eased considerably”.
Turning to financing conditions for various types of collateral in securities financing transactions, survey respondents reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum amount of funding offered against euro-denominated collateral. While respondents also reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum maturity of funding for average clients, a significant percentage of respondents reported an increase in the maximum maturity of funding secured against domestic government bonds for most-favoured clients. With the exception of domestic government bonds, financing rates/spreads increased for funding secured against all types of collateral. The most pronounced increases in financing rates/spreads were observed for asset-backed securities, high‑quality non-financial corporate bonds and high-yield corporate bonds. Respondents also reported an increase in overall demand for funding, which was even more pronounced for funding with a maturity of greater than 30 days.
Finally, turning to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements had decreased for commodity derivatives, but few changes were reported for other types of derivative. Survey respondents reported a mixed picture as regards the maximum amount of exposure and the maximum maturity of trades. Liquidity and trading deteriorated somewhat for foreign exchange derivatives, credit derivatives referencing corporates and structured credit products, and total return swaps referencing non-securities. Finally, survey participants reported an overall decline in the volume, duration and persistence of valuation disputes.
The results of the June 2023 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The June 2023 survey collected qualitative information on changes between March and May 2023. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Proposed legislation establishes framework facilitating the possible introduction of a digital euro that is widely usable and available throughout the euro area
ECB also welcomes Commission proposal to protect legal tender status of euro cash
Governing Council to decide in autumn whether to move to next phase of digital euro project
The European Commission has published today its legislative proposal on a digital euro.
Like banknotes and coins are now, a digital euro would be a universal means of payment across the entire euro area. The proposed legal tender status for the digital euro would ensure it is widely accepted as a means of payment. The provision that people can get digital euros through their bank on request would make it easily accessible and ensures that nobody would be left behind.
The proposal also foresees that people could use basic digital euro services for free. At the same time, the proposal offers private intermediaries appropriate economic incentives to distribute the digital euro as they do other digital means of payment, while preventing excessive fees for merchants.
Moreover, the proposed legislation supports a high degree of privacy and data protection for users, while minimising money laundering and terrorist financing risks. It enables offline digital euro payments, to provide cash-like privacy levels.
“The euro is the most tangible symbol of European integration”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “It is highly valued and trusted by citizens. We look forward to continuing working together with other EU institutions towards a digital euro to ensure our currency is fit for the digital age.”
The investigation phase of the digital euro project will conclude in October 2023. The Governing Council of the ECB will then decide whether to move to the next phase of the project. In the next phase, the ECB would further develop and test the technical solutions and business arrangements. A possible decision by the Governing Council to issue a digital euro would be taken only after the legislative act is adopted.
“The legislative proposal is key to ensuring that the digital euro brings value to the people, taking the appreciated features of cash into the digital sphere”, said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “The ECB also welcomes the Commission’s proposal on the legal tender status of euro cash, to ensure banknotes remain easily accessible for citizens and businesses and widely accepted throughout the euro area.”
The ECB welcomes the Commission’s proposal aiming to ensure that cash continues to be a vital part of the payments system. It is crucial that cash remains widely accepted in physical transactions in line with its legal tender status. People and businesses need to be able to efficiently withdraw and deposit their money. The legislative proposal ensures that both acceptance of and access to euro banknotes and coins is legally guaranteed, so that everyone who wants to pay with cash can do so.
The ECB stands ready to provide technical input to support the work of the EU co-legislators. The European Commission has recommended that the European Parliament and the EU Council consult the ECB on the proposed legislative changes. Following requests for consultation, the ECB would deliver its opinion in due course.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published consolidated banking data as at end-2022, a dataset for the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
These annual data provide information required to analyse the EU banking sector and are broader in scope than the standard quarterly releases. The data cover 314 banking groups and 2,375 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), accounting for nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. They include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheet composition, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample.
Reporters generally apply the International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s Implementing Technical Standards on Supervisory Reporting. However, some small and medium-sized reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may include some data that are based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
As a consequence of the global financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision strengthened its framework, establishing, among other things, a minimum requirement for funding: the net stable funding ratio. This was implemented via the revised version of the Capital Requirements Regulation that was published in June 2019 and became applicable on 28 June 2021 with the aim of preventing excessive maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding.
In addition to data as at end-December 2022, the published figures also include a few revisions to past data.

Euro remains second most widely used currency, amid geopolitical risks and high inflation
Euro’s share at around 20% across various indicators of international currency use
Euro’s global appeal linked to stronger Economic and Monetary Union
The international role of the euro was resilient in 2022, with its share across various indicators of international currency use averaging close to 20%. This was one of the main findings in the annual review of the international role of the euro, published today by the European Central Bank (ECB).
Last year was marked by the onset of Russia’s war in Ukraine and heightened geopolitical risks, in a context of rising inflationary pressures. Against that backdrop, the euro remained the second most important currency globally.
“Despite a succession of new shocks, the international role of the euro remained resilient in 2022. This resilience was noteworthy”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “However, international currency status should not be taken for granted. This new landscape increases the onus on European policy makers to create the conditions for the euro to thrive”.
The share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased by 0.5 percentage points to 20.5% in 2022, when measured at constant exchange rates. The share of the euro increased across most other market segments, such as in foreign exchange settlements and in the outstanding stocks of international debt securities, loans and deposits. The international role of the euro in foreign currency-denominated bond issuance, including international green bonds, as well as in invoicing of extra-euro area imports and exports, remained stable.
Looking ahead, the international role of the euro will be primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union, including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete Economic and Monetary Union.
“Further European economic and financial integration will be pivotal in increasing the resilience of the international role of the euro in a potentially more fragmented world economy,” said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta.
This year’s interim edition of the report includes three special features. The first sheds light on the future of the international monetary system in the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine. It notes that evidence of potential fragmentation of the international monetary system in the wake of Russia’s invasion is not indicative of broader trends.
The second special feature reviews the evidence on the way in which one leading international currency can be replaced by another, drawing on new ECB staff research into invoicing currency patterns among countries neighbouring the euro area. The third feature looks at the role international currencies play in global finance, and provides insights into determinants of currency choice in cross-border bank lending.

Inflation has been coming down but is projected to remain too high for too long. The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. It therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points.
The rate increase today reflects the Governing Council’s updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. According to the June macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem staff expect headline inflation to average 5.4% in 2023, 3.0% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Indicators of underlying price pressures remain strong, although some show tentative signs of softening. Staff have revised up their projections for inflation excluding energy and food, especially for this year and next year, owing to past upward surprises and the implications of the robust labour market for the speed of disinflation. They now see it reaching 5.1% in 2023, before it declines to 3.0% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. Staff have slightly lowered their economic growth projections for this year and next year. They now expect the economy to grow by 0.9% in 2023, 1.5% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025.
At the same time, the Governing Council’s past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to financing conditions and are gradually having an impact across the economy. Borrowing costs have increased steeply and growth in loans is slowing. Tighter financing conditions are a key reason why inflation is projected to decline further towards target, as they are expected to increasingly dampen demand.
The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, its interest rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council confirms that it will discontinue the reinvestments under the asset purchase programme as of July 2023.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 4.00%, 4.25% and 3.50% respectively, with effect from 21 June 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023. The Governing Council will discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations and their ongoing repayment are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Euro area firms signalled a continued increase in turnover, while higher labour, production and interest costs weighed on their profitability. Turnover is expected to increase further over the next six months.
Lack of skilled labour and rising input costs were widely reported as the main concerns.
Over the next year, firms expect their selling prices and wage costs to increase on average by 6.1% and 5.4%, respectively.
A comprehensive indicator of how firms perceive financing conditions shows a continued deterioration (47%), the highest since the start of the survey in 2009.
The net percentage of firms reporting tighter price terms and conditions for bank loans reached a historical high.
In the latest round of the twice-yearly Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, covering the period from October 2022 to March 2023, firms indicated a continuing improvement in business activity, with increased turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1).
A net
[

]
16% of SMEs reported a deterioration in profits, while large firms signalled no change in profits on balance. Lower profitability reflects a rise in the cost of labour, with the net percentage of firms reporting an increase in labour costs (77%) reaching a new historical peak in the survey. The net percentage of firms indicating a rise in costs for materials and energy (89%) remained high, although it was slightly below the figure reported in the previous survey round. This reflected an easing in supply bottlenecks, along with falling energy prices. Increasing interest expenses also had a negative impact on profitability, with the net percentage standing at its highest level since the survey started. Increases in labour costs and interest expenses were reported more broadly by large firms than by SMEs, while the net percentage of firms indicating an increase in other costs was similar across firm sizes.
The latest survey round provides quantitative information on euro area firms’ expectations about their selling prices and wages over the next 12 months. Firms reported on average that they expect their selling prices to increase by 6.1% and their employees’ wages to rise by 5.4% over the next 12 months (Chart 2).

]
Labour and non-labour input costs, inflation expectations and demand conditions were reported to be the most important factors for firms’ price-setting behaviour over the next year.
Firms’ replies on external financing needs and availability continued to reflect the monetary policy tightening. Compared with the previous survey round, fewer euro area firms reported a net increase in demand for external financing across instruments, while availability deteriorated slightly. This resulted in a net 6% of firms reporting a widening of the financing gap (compared with 9% in the last survey round). The smaller increase in the financing gap was mainly due to a lower net percentage of large firms signalling a wider financing gap in this survey round (net 6%, down from 11% in the previous round, Chart 3).
In addition, euro area firms reported a tightening in financing conditions. In particular, a net 87% cited higher bank interest rates (up from 71% in the previous round), reflecting the transmission of the monetary policy tightening to the cost of borrowing for corporations. A comprehensive indicator of how firms perceive financing conditions shows a continued deterioration (47%), the highest since the start of the survey in 2009.
Despite tighter financing conditions, the net percentage of firms reporting obstacles to obtaining a bank loan remained broadly unchanged at 7%, with net percentages of 5% for large firms and 9% for SMEs.
Looking ahead, euro area firms expect a further deterioration in the availability of bank loans and credit lines in the coming six months, but expect an improvement in the availability of internal funds in net terms.
The report published today presents the main results of the 28th round of the SAFE in the euro area, conducted between 6 March and 14 April 2023 and covering the period from October 2022 to March 2023. The sample comprised 10,983 enterprises, of which 10,085 (92%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-28 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to October 2022-March 2023).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages."

Compared with March 2023:
consumer inflation expectations decreased significantly – reversing most of the increases seen in the previous month;
expectations declined for both nominal income growth and nominal spending growth over the next 12 months;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expect lower growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead declined.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months decreased to 8.9% in April 2023, from 9.9% in March. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased to 4.1% in April, from 5.0% in March, and those for inflation three years ahead decreased to 2.5%, from 2.9% in March. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead also decreased. Thus, the increases observed in March have largely been reversed. Inflation expectations, particularly at the three-year horizon, remained well below the perceived past inflation rate. Inflation perceptions and expectations continued to be closely aligned across income classes, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) reporting lower inflation perceptions and expectations and sharper declines than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income over the next 12 months to rise more slowly, by 1.1%, compared with 1.3% in March. The decline in expected nominal income growth was concentrated in the first four quintiles of the income distribution – consumers’ expectations in the fifth (highest) income quintile were on average unchanged. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable compared with March, at 7.0%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months reverted close to February’s value, falling to 3.8% in April from 4.1% in March. Developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending growth continued to be broadly aligned across age classes. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months were less negative in April, standing at -0.8% compared with -1.0% in March. In line with expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead decreased to 11.2% in April, from 11.7% in March. Consumers expected the future unemployment rate to remain higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.0%), but the gap had narrowed to some extent. Quarterly data show that in April 2023 unemployed respondents reported their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months had fallen to 26.6%, from 28.1% in January 2023. Employed respondents reported that their expected probability of losing their job over the next three months had decreased to 7.8% in April, from 8.1% in January. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
In April consumers expected the price of their home to increase by 2.2% over the next 12 months – the lowest value reported for two years – compared with 2.7% in March. The decline in expectations was broad-based across age and income classes. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead edged down to 5.0% in April. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened compared with March, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months remained unchanged from March. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.4% in April from 13.6% in January 2023. This reflects a fall in new credit applications reported by younger respondents, which was partly compensated for by a rise in those reported by older respondents (aged above 34).

Number of bank offices continued to decline in most EU Member States, by 5.39% on average
Number of bank employees declined by 1.25% on average
Degree of banking sector concentration continues to differ widely across countries
The European Central Bank (ECB) has updated its dataset of structural financial indicators for the banking sector in the European Union (EU) for the end of 2022. This annual dataset comprises statistics on the number of offices and employees of EU credit institutions, data on banking sector concentration in each EU Member State and data on foreign-controlled institutions operating in the EU.
The structural financial indicators show a further decline in the number of bank offices in the EU, averaging 5.39% across Member States. Decreases were observed in 25 of the 27 countries, ranging from -0.98% to -21.54%. The total number of offices in the EU was 132,871 at the end of 2022, of which 82.8% were located in the euro area.
In the course of 2022, the number of employees of credit institutions fell in 18 EU Member States, with an average drop of 1.25% across all countries. This decline in the number of bank employees is a trend seen in most countries since 2008.
The data also indicate that the degree of banking sector concentration (measured by the share of assets held by the five largest banks) continues to vary considerably between EU Member States. At national level the share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions ranged from 31.16% (Luxembourg) to 95.72% (Greece) at the end of 2022, while the EU average was 68.27%.
The structural financial indicators are published annually by the ECB.

Tighter financial conditions test resilience of households, firms, governments and property markets
Financial markets are vulnerable to disorderly adjustments, given investment fund vulnerabilities, stretched valuations, high volatility and low liquidity
Euro area banks robust to recent stress outside the euro area, but higher funding costs and lower asset quality may weigh on profitability
According to the May 2023 Financial Stability Review published today by the European Central Bank (ECB), the outlook for euro area financial stability remains fragile, in the context of recent banking stress outside the currency union.
While economic conditions have improved slightly, uncertain growth prospects paired with persistent inflation and tightening financing conditions continue to weigh on the balance sheets of firms, households and governments. Furthermore, an unexpected deterioration in economic conditions or financial tightening could lead to disorderly price adjustments in either or both financial and real estate markets.
“Price stability is crucial for durable financial stability,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “But as we tighten monetary policy to reduce high inflation, this can reveal vulnerabilities in the financial system. It is critical that we monitor such vulnerabilities and fully implement the banking union to keep them in check.”
Looking more closely at vulnerabilities, euro area firms face tighter financing conditions and uncertain business prospects. This could be particularly challenging for those firms that came out of the pandemic with greater debt and weaker earnings. At the same time, high inflation is hitting households – particularly those on lower incomes – by reducing their purchasing power and compromising their ability to repay loans. Demand for new loans, especially mortgages, declined sharply in the first quarter of 2023 in response to rising interest rates. While falling energy prices in recent months have reduced pressures on governments to fund additional fiscal support, public authorities nevertheless face rising funding costs.
Euro area real estate markets are undergoing a correction. In residential markets, house price increases have cooled considerably over the last few months, reducing overvaluation in the sector. While price adjustments have been orderly so far, they could turn disorderly if higher mortgage rates increasingly reduced demand. Commercial real estate markets remain in a downturn, facing tighter financing conditions and an uncertain economic outlook, as well as weaker demand following the pandemic. The ongoing correction could test the resilience of investment funds with interests in the commercial real estate sector.
Financial markets and investment funds remain vulnerable to asset price adjustments. Stretched valuations, tighter financing conditions and lower market liquidity might increase the risk of any adjustment becoming disorderly, particularly in the event of renewed recession fears. So far, investment funds have been largely unaffected by recent tensions in the US and Swiss banking sectors. This could change, however, if funds suddenly required liquidity, forcing them to sell assets quickly.
Euro area banks have also proved resilient to stresses in US and Swiss banks on account of their limited exposures. This resilience was supported by strong capital and liquidity positions resulting from regulators’ and supervisors’ efforts over recent years. It will be essential to preserve this resilience amid some concerns about banks’ ability to build up capital. For example, higher interest rates reduce lending volumes and increase banks’ funding costs, which may impair their profitability. Furthermore, there are already signs of deteriorating asset quality in loan portfolios exposed to commercial real estate, smaller firms and consumer loans. Banks may therefore need to set aside more funds to cover losses and manage their credit risks.
In this context, it is essential to complete the banking union and, in particular, to establish a common European deposit insurance scheme. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector require a comprehensive and decisive policy response in order to further increase trust in the financial system and its ability to withstand risks.

Card fraud in 2021 falls to lowest level since start of data collection
12% decline in card-not-present fraud after introduction of strong customer authentication
63% of total value of card fraud involves cross-border transactions
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its card fraud report, which is based on information provided by 20 card payment scheme operators. Card fraud in 2021 continued its downward trend, falling to its lowest level since data collection began. It constituted 0.028% of the total value of card payments made using cards issued in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), amounting to €1.53 billion from a total value of €5.40 trillion. By comparison, card fraud in 2019 amounted to €1.87 billion from a total value of €5.16 trillion. The highest share of card fraud observed to date was 0.048% in 2008.
There are two distinct types of card fraud: (1) card-not-present fraud, i.e. fraud conducted remotely in online and telephone payments, using card details obtained by scams such as phishing; and (2) card-present fraud, which typically occurs at retail outlets and ATMs and involves the use of counterfeit cards.
Card-not-present fraud, which accounted for approximately 84% of the total value of card fraud in 2021, declined by 12% from 2020 following the market-wide implementation of strong customer authentication under the revised EU Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Card-present fraud fell by 6% in 2021 from its 2020 level, owing to the continued global roll-out of industry standards, which have been effective in reducing opportunities to commit magnetic stripe counterfeit fraud.
As in previous reports, most of the card fraud in both 2020 and 2021 involved cross-border transactions. Although cross-border transactions only accounted for 11% of the total value of card payment transactions, they accounted for 63% of the total value of card fraud in 2021.

The Eurosystem is closely monitoring trends in card fraud in its capacity as overseer of card payment schemes operating in the euro area. Statistical information on the volumes and values of card transactions and corresponding fraud is collected, analysed and reported regularly. The latest report on card fraud focuses on data for both 2020 and 2021, providing a more differentiated overview of the impact on card fraud of both the recent regulatory measures and the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Fraud data for 2022 is currently being collected.

Compared with February 2023:
consumer inflation expectations increased significantly;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months were broadly stable, while expectations for nominal spending growth rose further;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became slightly more negative and the expected unemployment rate in 12 months’ time increased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months increased to 9.9% in March 2023, from 8.7% in February. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased, moving from 4.6% in February to 5.0%. Expectations for inflation three years ahead also increased, from 2.4% to 2.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the three years horizon. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead reached its highest level since the start of the survey in April 2020. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to increase by 1.3% over the next 12 months, up from 1.2% in February. Expected nominal income growth declined for older consumers (aged 55 and above), while it increased for younger consumers (aged 18-34). Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months rose to 7.1%, from 6.6% in February. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months increased to 4.1%, from 3.9% in February. The developments in perceptions and expectations about nominal spending remained largely aligned across income and age groups. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined slightly to -1.0%, from -0.9% in February. In line with these lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead increased to 11.7%, compared with 11.5% in February. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.3%). The lowest income quintile reported the highest expected and perceived unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected the price of their home over the next 12 months to increase by 2.7%. While somewhat higher than in previous months, home price growth expectations remained well below those recorded in the first half of 2022. This increase mainly reflected higher expectations of respondents with below-median incomes and of younger respondents (aged 18-34). Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to edge up to 5.1%, standing 1.8 percentage points above the expectations recorded at the start of 2022. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both tightened compared with February. (Housing and credit access results)

HICP inflation expectations revised down for 2023; counterbalancing revisions for 2024 (down) and 2025 (up); longer-term expectations unchanged
Real GDP growth expectations revised up for 2023, but down slightly for 2024 and 2025
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for 2023-25
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2023, respondents’ expectations for headline HICP inflation in 2023 were revised down compared with the previous survey round, while their expectations for HICP inflation excluding food and energy in 2023 were revised up. The downward revision of headline inflation expectations primarily reflects lower expected energy price inflation (particularly for natural gas), while the upward revision for HICP inflation excluding food and energy mainly reflects recent data outturns, as well as higher wage growth forecasts. Headline inflation expectations for 2023, 2024 and 2025 now stand at 5.6%, 2.6% and 2.2% respectively, while longer-term inflation expectations (which relate to 2027) remain unchanged at 2.1%.
Expectations for real GDP growth were revised up for 2023, but down slightly for 2024 and 2025. The upward revision for 2023 primarily reflects a carry-over from stronger than expected growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, while the downward revisions for 2024 and 2025 mainly reflect the tightening of financial conditions. Longer-term expectations remained unchanged at 1.4%.
Expected unemployment rates were revised down by 0.1-0.2 percentage points for the period 2023-25. The unemployment rate is now expected to rise to 6.8% in 2023 (having stood at 6.6% in February 2023) and remain at that level in 2024, before declining gradually to stand at 6.5% in 2027."
4 May 2023,"4 May 2023
The inflation outlook continues to be too high for too long. In light of the ongoing high inflation pressures, the Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Overall, the incoming information broadly supports the assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook that the Governing Council formed at its previous meeting. Headline inflation has declined over recent months, but underlying price pressures remain strong. At the same time, the past rate increases are being transmitted forcefully to euro area financing and monetary conditions, while the lags and strength of transmission to the real economy remain uncertain.
The Governing Council’s future decisions will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary. The Governing Council will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions will continue to be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The key ECB interest rates remain the Governing Council’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. In parallel, the Governing Council will keep reducing the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio at a measured and predictable pace. In line with these principles, the Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 3.75%, 4.00% and 3.25% respectively, with effect from 10 May 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023. The Governing Council expects to discontinue the reinvestments under the APP as of July 2023.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Banks reported a further substantial net tightening in credit standards for loans to firms and for house purchase
Demand for loans decreased strongly, driven by rising interest rates, lower fixed investment and weakening housing markets
Ongoing reduction in central bank balance sheet linked to TLTRO repayments and end of full APP reinvestments contributing to weakening lending dynamics
According to the April 2023 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further substantially (with the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening standing at 27%) in the first quarter of 2023 (see Chart 1). From a historical perspective, the pace of net tightening in credit standards remained at the highest level since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Banks also reported a further substantial net tightening of their credit standards for loans to households for house purchase, while the further net tightening became less pronounced for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentages of banks at 19% and 10% respectively). The tightening for loans to firms and for house purchase was stronger than banks had expected in the previous quarter and points to a persistent weakening of loan dynamics. The main drivers of the tightening were higher perceptions of risk and, to a lesser extent, banks’ lower risk tolerance. Against the backdrop of increases in ECB key interest rates and decreases in central bank liquidity, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet conditions also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. In the second quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect a further, though more moderate, tightening of credit standards on loans to firms and for house purchase. For consumer credit, euro area banks expect a further net tightening of credit standards at a similar pace as in the first quarter of 2023.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened further for loans to firms and loans to households in the first quarter of 2023. Widening margins on riskier loans and rising interest rates accounted for the main tightening effect, reflecting the ongoing pass-through of higher market rates to lending rates for firms and households.
Banks reported a strong net decrease in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the first quarter of 2023 (see Chart 2). The decline in net demand was stronger than expected by banks in the previous quarter and is the strongest since the global financial crisis. The general level of interest rates was reported to be the main driver of reduced loan demand, in an environment of monetary policy tightening. Fixed investment also had a strong dampening effect on loan demand. The impact of inventories and working capital turned broadly neutral, after having previously had a positive impact on loan demand. This may reflect the easing of supply bottlenecks and a moderation in energy input costs. In the second quarter of 2023, banks expect a further though smaller net decline in demand for loans to firms.
The net decrease in demand for housing loans remained strong and was close to the sharp net decrease reported for the previous quarter, which was the highest on record since the start of the survey in 2003. There was a smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit and other lending to households. Rising interest rates, weakening housing market prospects, low consumer confidence and a decline in spending on durable consumer goods contributed negatively to the demand for loans to households. In the second quarter of 2023 banks expect a further strong net decrease in housing loan demand and a somewhat smaller net decrease in demand for consumer credit than in the first quarter.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail and wholesale funding deteriorated in the first quarter. For money markets and debt securities, the deterioration reverses the improvement in access to these markets registered at the end of last year, possibly reflecting the March 2023 market turmoil and the lower overall level of excess liquidity. For retail funding, the deterioration in access reflects the continued increase in bank deposit rates and shifts towards more highly remunerated types of saving.
Banks reported that the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio – for which changes can arise as a result of any transactions, including less than full reinvestments from maturing securities – had a negative impact on their market financing conditions, liquidity positions and total assets over the past six months. The reported impact on profitability was broadly neutral. Developments in the ECB’s monetary policy asset portfolio and the related tightening of monetary policy had a net tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households and a negative impact on bank lending volumes across all categories of lending.
Euro area banks indicated that the ongoing phase-out of TLTRO III has had a negative impact on their liquidity positions, profitability and their overall funding conditions over the past six months in the context of TLTRO III funds maturing or being voluntarily repaid early. The phase-out of TLTRO III had a tightening impact on credit standards. The impact on lending volumes is expected to turn negative across all categories of lending over the next six months.
In response to a new question introduced in this survey round, euro area banks have indicated that the ECB key interest rate decisions have had a marked positive impact on their net interest margins over the past six months. At the same time, while the impact on overall bank profitability was positive, the positive impact on banks’ interest margins was partly offset by a negative volume effect on net interest income. This is in line with the substantial weakening of loan and deposit dynamics over the past six months. Additional negative impacts stemmed from capital losses and net fee and commission income.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the April 2023 survey relate to changes observed in the first quarter of 2023 and expected changes in the second quarter of 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The April 2023 survey round was conducted between 22 March and 6 April 2023. In this round, the size of the sample of banks surveyed was increased to 158 banks, mainly reflecting the enlargement of the euro area to include Croatia on 1 January 2023. The response rate was 100%.

Exploration of potential solutions for central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions recorded on distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms
New market contact group to foster dialogue and information exchange with industry
The Eurosystem is to look into how wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms could be settled in central bank money. The purpose of this initiative is to (i) consolidate and further develop the ongoing work of Eurosystem central banks in this area, and (ii) gain insight into how different solutions could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and DLT platforms.
A dedicated market contact group will be set up to support the Eurosystem’s exploratory work. This group will provide expert input and keep the Eurosystem abreast of advances in the use of DLT and other new technologies in wholesale financial markets.
The work is part of the Eurosystem’s broader efforts to ensure that developments in central bank money keep pace with and contribute to digital innovation in wholesale and retail payments, and that central bank money remains a monetary anchor that supports the stability, integration and efficiency of the European financial system and payments system.

Euro money market activity dominated by secured and foreign exchange swap segments
Turnover in secured and unsecured segments concentrated in very short-term tenors
Largest share of trades in secured segment cleared by central counterparties, while non-banks were most active counterparty in unsecured segment
Effective transmission of ECB policy rates to unsecured money market rates
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its Euro money market study 2022, which shows that daily aggregate turnover in the euro money market had grown by 23% to €1.3 trillion at the end of 2022, up from €1 trillion at the end of 2020. During 2021 and 2022 activity increased in all five segments under review: secured (+7%), unsecured (+40%), short-term securities (+51%), foreign exchange swaps (+35%) and overnight index swaps (+159%). It was also largely concentrated in the secured and foreign exchange swap segments, with the former accounting for more than half of the total turnover.
The study also reveals that activity in the unsecured and secured money market segments was highly concentrated in the very short-term tenors (overnight, spot/next and tomorrow/next). Non-bank counterparties were involved in 80% of the unsecured money market trades, while 70% of the trades in the secured segment were cleared by central counterparties. Compared with the period 2019-20, the footprint of non-bank counterparties and central counterparties in the unsecured and secured segments respectively therefore remained broadly similar.
The study finds that changes in the ECB’s policy rates in 2022 were immediately and completely reflected in money market rates in the unsecured segment, while their transmission to rates in the secured segment was less uniform across euro area jurisdictions and partially lagged.

Notes
The ECB’s Euro money market study 2022 provides a detailed overview of the euro money market in the review period from January 2021 to December 2022. It focuses on key developments and dynamics in five euro money market segments: secured, unsecured, short-term securities, foreign exchange swaps and overnight index swaps.
The study is based on daily transactions in the euro money market collected from the largest euro area banks under Regulation (EU) No 1333/2014 of the European Central Bank of 26 November 2014 concerning statistics on the money markets (ECB/2014/48) (OJ L 359, 16.12.2014, p. 97) – the Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR) Regulation."

ECB and other major central banks to revert the frequency of 7-day US dollar operations from daily to once per week
New frequency effective as of 1 May 2023
ECB and other major central banks stand ready to re-adjust provision of US dollar liquidity as warranted by market conditions
In view of the improvements in US dollar funding conditions and the low demand at recent US dollar liquidity-providing operations, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, have jointly decided to revert the frequency of their 7-day operations from daily to once per week. This operational change will be effective as of 1 May 2023, and 7-day operations will be held according to the posted schedules.
These central banks stand ready to re-adjust the provision of US dollar liquidity as warranted by market conditions. The swap lines among these central banks are available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad.

Digital euro potentially available initially to euro area residents, merchants and governments
Digital euro could be made available via existing banking apps and Eurosystem app
Offline and person-to-person payments across euro area seen as highly valued
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published the third progress report on the digital euro, as well as the findings of focus groups commissioned by the ECB concerning people’s views on the features of a potential digital wallet.
The progress report presents a third set of design and distribution options, endorsed by the ECB’s Governing Council, that would feed into the overall design of a digital euro. In its initial releases, a digital euro would be accessible to euro area residents, merchants and governments. Non-resident euro area citizens might also have access, provided that they held an account with a euro area-based payment services provider (PSP). In further releases, consumers from selected third countries could also have access, depending on accessibility rules to be set out in the legislative framework for a digital euro. The report also anticipates the potential provision of cross-currency functionalities with other central bank digital currencies outside the euro area.
The Governing Council also proposes that a digital euro could be distributed via PSPs, as defined in the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). A digital euro could be made available to euro area residents via existing banking apps or via an app provided by the Eurosystem offering a harmonised entry point for basic payment functionalities provided by PSPs. Supervised intermediaries – e.g. banks distributing digital euro – would be required to provide a set of mandatory core services to end-users and could offer additional services. These could include conditional payments or the ability to split person-to-person payments among multiple parties.
The report also indicates that the design of the digital euro would be adjusted, as needed, to comply with the legal framework to be adopted by European co-legislators.
The ECB has today also published the findings of a commissioned study using focus groups to evaluate people’s views on specific features of a potential digital wallet. The study found that most participants were interested in trying some of the digital wallet features presented. The concrete findings are relevant to the design features of a possible digital euro.
The study shows that person-to-person money transfers – available throughout the euro area – are considered an essential feature for a digital wallet. Offline payments, which are currently not widely available, are deemed a useful feature when, for example, someone has limited connectivity. Participants also valued budget management tools and conditional payments, including payment on delivery and pay-per-use.
This qualitative study, based on data from focus groups and in-depth interviews, was conducted in all euro area countries from December 2022 to January 2023. Participants included (i) members of the general public, (ii) people with knowledge of technology, (iii) small and larger merchants and retailers, and (iv) individuals with limited access to banking services or the internet.
“We value the views and needs of our fellow Europeans very highly. We listen to them. The digital euro project is for the people of Europe”, said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “The Eurosystem is committed to ensuring a digital euro would be fit for purpose in a digital economy. The findings from these reports will feed into our decision on the future of the project, which will be taken in the autumn.”

Only one-quarter of EU climate-related catastrophe losses currently insured; gap expected to widen as impact of climate change grows
Insurance gap poses risks to economy and financial stability
ECB and EIOPA outline policy options to promote climate catastrophe insurance
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) today published a joint discussion paper on how to better insure households and businesses in the European Union against climate-related natural catastrophes such as floods or wildfires. The policy options set out in the paper are aimed at boosting the uptake and efficiency of climate catastrophe insurance while creating incentives to adapt to and reduce climate risks.
“We need to increase the uptake of climate catastrophe insurance to limit the growing impact of natural disasters on the economy and the financial system,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “However, to reduce losses in the first place, we must ensure that a smooth and speedy green transition is complemented by effective measures to adapt to climate change.”
EIOPA Chairperson Petra Hielkema added: “Insurance plays a major role in protecting businesses and people against climate-related catastrophe losses by swiftly providing the necessary funds for reconstruction. In order to efficiently protect our society, we need to address the concern of the increasing insurance protection gap by proposing and finding appropriate solutions.”
Currently, only about one-quarter of all climate-related catastrophe losses in the European Union are insured. In some countries, the figure is below 5%. This is partly because many people underestimate the costs of climate-related damage. Some also shy away from insurance, preferring to rely on government support. As natural disasters become both more frequent and more severe, insurance costs are expected to rise. Some insurers may reduce risk coverage or stop providing certain types of catastrophe insurance altogether, which would widen the insurance gap further.
The lack of climate catastrophe insurance can affect the economy and financial stability. If losses are not covered by insurance, the speed at which households and firms can resume their activities is reduced, slowing economic recovery. Lasting supply chain disruptions can also lead to spillovers from one firm to another and affect firms’ ability to pay back loans, thereby increasing banks’ exposures to credit risk. Additionally, the financial position of governments may be weakened if they need to provide relief to cover uninsured losses.
To foster insurance coverage, the ECB and EIOPA suggest that insurers should design their policies to encourage households and firms to reduce risk, for example by granting discounts for implementing effective mitigation or adaptation measures. To support the overall supply of insurance, the use of catastrophe bonds could be increased to pass on part of the risk to capital market investors. In the same vein, governments could set up public-private partnerships and backstops to partly cover the costs that insurers may incur in the event of major disasters. To protect themselves and ensure that public funds are used efficiently, governments should also provide strong incentives to reduce risks. Finally, national-level insurance schemes could be complemented by an EU-wide public scheme that makes sure sufficient funds are made available to European countries for reconstruction following rare, large-scale climate-related catastrophes.
The joint discussion paper is part of the ECB’s climate agenda and, more broadly, its work to improve understanding of climate-related risk. The paper aims to foster debate on how to tackle the climate insurance protection gap. The ECB and EIOPA will collect feedback on the policy options and also discuss them in a workshop with regulators, policymakers, insurers and academics on 22 May 2023.

24 new banks to be added on 1 July 2024 to the 47 banks currently reporting to the Money Market Statistics Reporting (MMSR)
Data from these new banks to be included in the euro short-term rate (€STR) at a later stage to continue providing a robust and reliable benchmark
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to expand the reporting population for Money Market Statistics Reporting (MMSR) by adding 24 new banks to the 47 banks currently reporting. The new MMSR reporting banks will start reporting on 1 July 2024, contributing to a higher representativeness of the MMSR data published by the ECB. At the same time the ECB has reviewed the current MMSR reporting population and decided to remove one bank from the reporting population. The ECB, as administrator of the euro short-term rate (€STR), has also decided that the inclusion of the MMSR data from the new reporting agents in the calculation of the €STR will take place at a later stage to ensure that the newly reported data is of sufficiently good quality. The increase in the reporting population will further support the robustness and reliability of the benchmark.

Notes
Money market statistical reporting is governed by ECB Regulation No 1333/2014 of 26 November 2014 (ECB/2014/48) concerning statistics on the money markets. Daily data collection by the ECB, conducted with the support of several national central banks, started in July 2016. Its main purpose is to provide the ECB with comprehensive, detailed and harmonised statistical information on the money markets in the euro area. They are a necessary set of statistics for monetary policy purposes in the euro area."

Proposed legislative changes seen as important and pragmatic step forward
ECB and SRB ready to provide technical input on proposals to ensure consistent and workable framework
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Single Resolution Board (SRB) welcome the European Commission’s proposed legislative changes to the European bank crisis management and deposit insurance framework.
“Over the past ten years, Europe has already made significant progress in establishing a robust framework for dealing with banks in financial difficulties and bank failures. Taking this a step further is something we very much welcome,” said Luis de Guindos and Andrea Enria, respectively Vice-President and Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB. “The legislative proposals will enable the authorities to manage bank crises in a more efficient and harmonised way and are therefore an important step towards completing the banking union.”
“The proposals contain many positive developments. For example, they clarify the scope of application of a resolution in relation to national liquidation procedures. They also enhance our toolkit for managing bank failures in a way that protects critical functions and citizens effectively,” said Dominique Laboureix, Chair of the SRB. “Going forward, it will be key to make sure – throughout the legislative process – that the different parts of the framework continue to form a coherent whole.”
The ECB and the SRB took part in the consultation process that led to the European Commission’s proposals and published related documents, such as the ECB contribution and the SRB contribution. Both institutions stand ready to provide technical input to further enhance the Commission’s proposals and ensure that the overall framework is consistent and workable.
The ECB notes that the European Commission has recommended that the European Parliament and the EU Council consult the ECB on the proposed legislative changes. Following requests for consultation, the ECB would deliver its opinion in due course.

Credit terms and conditions tightened for all counterparty types over December 2022 to February 2023 review period and year to March
Maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding offered against euro-denominated government bonds increased over review period
Initial margin requirements for most non-centrally cleared over-the-counter derivatives increased over review period
The March 2023 Survey on credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets (SESFOD) marks the tenth anniversary of this survey. The three-monthly SESFOD is an important input into the ECB’s financial stability and market functioning analyses such as the Financial Stability Review.
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened slightly over the December 2022 to February 2023 review period for all counterparty types. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparty types except sovereigns, and in particular for banks and dealers. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions was mainly attributed to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning. It continued the trend reported for the previous seven quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the December 2022 survey. Survey respondents expect overall credit terms to tighten further over the period from March to May 2023. The practices of central counterparties, including margin requirements and haircuts, contributed slightly to the tightening of survey respondents’ price and non-price terms. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased in the December 2022 to February 2023 review period, continuing developments reported since the March 2022 survey round. The use of financial leverage decreased for investment funds and insurance companies over the review period. Hedge funds intensified efforts to negotiate more favourable terms.

Note: Net percentage is defined as the difference between the percentage of respondents reporting “tightened somewhat” or “tightened considerably” and the percentage reporting “eased somewhat” or “eased considerably”.
In the case of securities financing transactions, a significant share of respondents reported that the maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding offered against euro-denominated securities had increased for most collateral types, but in particular for government bonds. Survey respondents also reported larger haircuts being applied to high-yield corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and covered bonds, while financing rates/spreads had increased for financing secured against all collateral types, in some cases significantly. In addition, they reported higher overall demand for funding, in particular funding with a maturity greater than 30 days. Liquidity had continued to deteriorate for all collateral types, in particular for high-yield corporate bonds, government bonds and financial corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements for most of these types of derivative had increased in the December 2022 to February 2023 review period. They reported an increase in the maximum amount of exposure for certain types of credit derivative, although a decrease was reported for commodity derivatives. Respondents reported an unchanged maximum maturity of trades for all types of derivative. Liquidity and trading improved somewhat for foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives but deteriorated for most other types of non-centrally cleared derivative.
The ECB included special questions in the March 2023 survey to look into the longer-term trend. The survey asked respondents to compare credit terms and conditions at the cut-off date of the March 2023 survey round (i.e. end of February 2023) with those reported in the March 2022 round. Compared with the previous year, overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had tightened for all counterparty types.
The March 2023 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The March 2023 survey collected qualitative information on changes between December 2022 and February 2023. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Compared with January 2023:
consumer inflation expectations declined further;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months edged down slightly, while expectations for nominal spending growth edged up;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased slightly.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months declined further to 8.7% in February 2023, from 9.5% in January. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months continued to decline, moving down from 4.9% in January to 4.6%. Expectations for inflation three years ahead edged down from 2.5% to 2.4%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the horizon of three years. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead was unchanged, remaining broadly in line with the elevated levels observed since March 2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.2% over the next 12 months, down from 1.3% in January. The small decline reflects the lower expectations of consumers in households with median or below-median incomes. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months rose to 6.6%, from 6.3% in January. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose slightly to 3.9%, from 3.8% in January. This slight increase was mainly driven by older respondents (aged 55-70). (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
While still pointing to a contraction, economic growth expectations for the next 12 months continued to increase, rising to -0.9% from -1.2% in January 2023. In line with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead declined to 11.5%, compared with 11.6% in January. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.1%). The lowest income quintile reported the highest expected and perceived unemployment rates. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to increase slightly to 2.6%, compared with 2.5% in January. This increase mainly reflects higher expectations of respondents below the age of 55, while older respondents expected a further deceleration in the growth of the price of their home. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead rose slightly to 5.0%, standing 1.7 percentage points above the expectations recorded at the start of 2022. At the same time, perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both improved slightly compared with January.

Share of women at top (senior and mid-management) and entry (analyst) levels in line with interim targets
Initiatives to attract female talent include flexible working, scholarship, mentoring and development programmes for women
Gender strategy is part of the ECB’s broader diversity and inclusion efforts
The European Central Bank (ECB) has achieved its interim gender targets for managers, which is particularly important for creating role models and mentoring. It has narrowed the gap at the expert (salary band F/G) and the team lead (H) levels and is making further efforts to increase hiring and promotion for these two categories. At the analyst level (E/F), the share of women has continued to grow in line with the ECB’s goals, which helps to extend the pool of eligible women for further career steps.

Gender targets are part of the ECB’s wider diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy to promote other aspects of diversity such as race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, nationality and disability, with the support of six D&I networks.
“A diverse and inclusive organisation reflects the world around us,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “It shows the intellectual courage to embrace the values of different perspectives, backgrounds and identities that will enrich debate and lead us to more robust decisions in all areas,” she added.
At the ECB, one parent is eligible for 20 weeks of paid maternity/adoption leave. In 2022 the ECB increased paid special leave for the other parent to 20 days from 10 days to promote greater balance in family responsibilities. It published nationality figures for its staff and management to increase transparency about a key diversity facet. The ECB initiated and co-signed the ESCB and SSM equality, diversity and inclusion charter together with 26 national central banks and supervisors in the European Union.
The next assessment will be based on data for 2024.

First climate-related disclosures show Eurosystem corporate sector portfolios and ECB non-monetary policy portfolios on decarbonisation path
Disclosures reflect Eurosystem-wide effort to boost transparency
Eurosystem to disclose climate-related information on additional portfolios
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its first climate-related financial disclosures, which provide information on its portfolios’ carbon footprint and exposure to climate risks, as well as on climate-related governance, strategy and risk management.
Presented in two reports, the disclosures cover the Eurosystem’s corporate security holdings under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) and the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), as well as the ECB’s euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios (NMPPs), including its own funds portfolio and its staff pension fund.
“These disclosures are a further piece of the puzzle in our efforts to contribute to fighting climate change,” says President Christine Lagarde. “They give us a clear view of our progress in decarbonising our portfolios and, over time, they will help us to chart the most effective course towards the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
The disclosures show that the corporate bonds held under the CSPP and PEPP are on a decarbonisation path. Although the portfolios’ absolute greenhouse gas emissions have increased in recent years because the Eurosystem has purchased more securities for monetary policy purposes, issuers’ carbon intensity has gradually declined. This is partly due to the fact that the companies in our portfolio have lowered their emissions for every million euro of revenue they earn, reflecting their efforts to significantly reduce their emissions and boost carbon efficiency.
A second factor reducing the relative emissions associated with corporate sector purchases since October 2022 is the ECB’s decision to tilt its holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance, which is helping to decarbonise the Eurosystem’s corporate sector portfolios on a path in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
The disclosures also show that the ECB has more than halved emissions from corporate and equity investments in its staff pension fund since 2019. These assets are already aligned with the Paris Agreement and low-carbon benchmarks, which has resulted in the reallocation of funds towards more carbon-efficient issuers, putting the portfolio on a firm decarbonisation path. For its own funds portfolio, the ECB has gradually increased the share of green bonds, up from 1% in 2019 to 13% in 2022. As this portfolio consists mainly of euro area government bonds, its decarbonisation depends to a large extent on countries’ efforts to reduce their emissions and meet Paris Agreement goals.
From now on, the ECB will disclose climate-related information on these portfolios every year, while continuously improving the disclosures as the quality and availability of data progress. Over time, it will expand the scope of the disclosures to cover other monetary policy portfolios, such as those under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and other assets under the PEPP. The ECB also aims to set interim decarbonisation targets for its own funds portfolio and staff pension fund to stay on track with Paris Agreement goals. Similarly, the ECB Governing Council will consider setting such targets for corporate sector portfolios.
The ECB’s NMPP disclosures are part of a concerted effort by all Eurosystem central banks to publish climate-related financial disclosures on their euro-denominated NMPPs using a common framework that defines minimum reporting requirements based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. A dedicated ECB page will list the disclosures of all Eurosystem central banks as they are published over the coming weeks.
By publishing these disclosures, the Eurosystem is delivering on one of the key commitments outlined in its climate change action plan. Looking ahead, the ECB will regularly review its climate-related measures to ensure, within its mandate, that it continues to support a decarbonisation path in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and EU climate neutrality objectives.

Notes
Euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios (NMPPs) contain the assets held by Eurosystem central banks that are not related to monetary policy operations. They include euro-denominated investment portfolios and staff pension funds that are managed by the national central banks, which have sole responsibility for their NMPPs and climate-related financial disclosures.
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures was created by the Financial Stability Board to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information, by developing recommendations on the types of information that companies should disclose."

Eurosystem’s new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and central liquidity management tool went live on 20 March 2023
New consolidated payment system successfully completed first day of operations
Upgraded system to contribute to harmonisation and efficiency of Europe’s financial markets
The Eurosystem has successfully launched the new T2 wholesale payment system, which comprises an RTGS system and a central liquidity management tool. Migration to the new system took place between 17 and 20 March 2023. T2 has replaced TARGET2 as the new RTGS system for settling payments related to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, as well as bank‑to‑bank and commercial transactions. TARGET2 processed payments worth €2.2 trillion per day on average. The first day of T2 operations went smoothly despite a delayed closure, the root cause of which was identified and fixed. The new RTGS system settled around 400,000 transactions, broadly in line with the average volume experienced before the migration.
The software and the environment for the new system were delivered by the Banca d’Italia, the Banco de España, the Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundesbank – the four national central banks that act as service providers for TARGET services (T2, TARGET2-Securities and TIPS). All Eurosystem central banks have supported their national communities throughout this project, and the successful launch reflects the commitment and efforts of all parties.
This project was initiated in December 2017 with the aim of harmonising and integrating TARGET services for the benefit of Europe’s financial markets and improving cost efficiency. The new system offers enhanced cyber resilience and optimises the use of liquidity, as participants are able to steer, manage and monitor liquidity in central bank money across all TARGET services. Harmonisation is achieved through a move to the ISO 20022 message standard, as well as a set of common components that are shared across TARGET services, bringing further cost savings for participants. Technical changes were made to TARGET2-Securities in July 2022 in preparation for the launch of the new T2 wholesale payment system, which brings the consolidation project to an end.
This project is part of the Eurosystem’s continued efforts to modernise market infrastructure, ensuring that it is future-proof and meets the needs and expectations of market participants, and further improving the efficiency of Europe’s financial markets.

Inflation is projected to remain too high for too long. Therefore, the Governing Council today decided to increase the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points, in line with its determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions, which will be determined by its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission.
The Governing Council is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area. The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions. In any case, the ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed and to preserve the smooth transmission of monetary policy.
The new ECB staff macroeconomic projections were finalised in early March before the recent emergence of financial market tensions. As such, these tensions imply additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of inflation and growth. Prior to these latest developments, the baseline path for headline inflation had already been revised down, mainly owing to a smaller contribution from energy prices than previously expected. ECB staff now see inflation averaging 5.3% in 2023, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025. At the same time, underlying price pressures remain strong. Inflation excluding energy and food continued to increase in February and ECB staff expect it to average 4.6% in 2023, which is higher than foreseen in the December projections. Subsequently, it is projected to come down to 2.5% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025, as the upward pressures from past supply shocks and the reopening of the economy fade out and as tighter monetary policy increasingly dampens demand.
The baseline projections for growth in 2023 have been revised up to an average of 1.0% as a result of both the decline in energy prices and the economy’s greater resilience to the challenging international environment. ECB staff then expect growth to pick up further, to 1.6%, in both 2024 and 2025, underpinned by a robust labour market, improving confidence and a recovery in real incomes. At the same time, the pick-up in growth in 2024 and 2025 is weaker than projected in December, owing to the tightening of monetary policy.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 3.50%, 3.75% and 3.00% respectively, with effect from 22 March 2023.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The APP portfolio is declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem does not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The ECB’s policy toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the euro area financial system if needed. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Compared with December 2022:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months and three years ahead declined;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months continued to rise, while expectations for nominal spending growth declined further;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months became less negative and expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers’ expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months weakened, while those for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained unchanged.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months declined to 9.5% in January 2023, from 9.9% in December 2022. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months edged down to 4.9% from 5.0%, while median expectations for inflation three years ahead declined significantly to 2.5%, from 3.0% in the previous month. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the horizon of three years. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead edged up but remained broadly in line with the elevated levels observed since March 2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption
Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.3% over the next 12 months, up from 1.0% in December. This improvement was primarily driven by respondents with household incomes below the median. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months were roughly stable at 6.3%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months moderated significantly to 3.8%, from 4.2% in the previous month. This decline was mainly driven by older respondents (aged 55-70). (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth
While still pointing to a contraction, economic growth expectations for the next 12 months continued to shift upwards to stand at -1.2%, from -1.5% in December 2022. In line with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead declined to 11.6%, compared with 11.9% in December. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.3%). Quarterly data showed that, in January 2023, respondents who were unemployed reported a marginal increase in their expected probability of finding a job over the next three months, which rose to 28.1%, from 27.9% in October 2022. Employed respondents reported that the expected probability of job loss over the next three months lessened more significantly, falling to 8.1% in January, from 9.2% in October 2022. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access
Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to weaken to 2.5%, compared with 3.0% in December 2022. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained broadly stable at 4.9%, which is 1.6 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months remained unchanged overall, while expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months improved slightly. The share of consumers who reported having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined to 13.6% in January, from 13.9% in October 2022.

ECB profit zero in 2022 (2021: €0.2 billion) after release of €1.6 billion from provision for financial risks
No profit distribution to euro area national central banks
The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) audited financial statements for 2022 show that the ECB’s profit was zero (2021: €192 million) and thus there will be no profit distribution to the euro area national central banks (NCBs). This result takes into account a release of €1,627 million from the provision for financial risks to cover losses incurred during the year. These losses mainly arose from the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability and security write-downs in the own funds and US dollar portfolios. After the release, the provision for financial risks declined to €6,566 million.
Net interest income totalled €900 million in 2022 (2021: €1,566 million). The main driver of the decrease compared to the previous year was the interest expense resulting from the ECB’s net TARGET2 liability, which amounted to €2,075 million (2021: €22 million interest income). Interest income earned on the ECB’s share of total euro banknotes in circulation and interest expense paid to the NCBs as remuneration of their claims in respect of foreign reserves transferred to the ECB amounted to €736 million and €201 million respectively (2021: zero for both). These changes resulted from increases in the interest rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to levels above 0% since 27 July 2022. Net interest income from securities held for monetary policy purposes increased to €1,534 million (2021: €1,006 million), while net interest income on foreign reserve assets increased to €798 million (2021: €197 million). These increases resulted mainly from higher euro area and US yields respectively.
Write-downs amounted to €1,840 million (2021: €133 million), mainly stemming from unrealised price losses on securities held in the own funds and US dollar portfolios owing to increased bond yields.
Impairment tests were conducted on the securities held by the ECB in its monetary policy portfolios, which are valued at amortised cost (subject to impairment). Based on the results of these tests, no impairment losses were recorded for these portfolios.
Total staff costs decreased to €652 million (2021: €674 million), mainly as a result of actuarial valuation gains relating to other long-term benefits. Other administrative expenses increased to €572 million (2021: €564 million), mainly because of a gradual return to normal levels of activity following the pandemic and the ongoing development and improvement of banking supervision-related IT systems.
Supervisory fee income, derived from fees charged to recover expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its supervisory tasks, amounted to €594 million (2021: €578 million).
The total size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €19 billion to €699 billion (2021: €680 billion). This increase was mainly due to securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the asset purchase programme (APP).
The ECB’s total paid-up capital increased by €0.6 billion to €8.9 billion after the payment of the second instalment by the euro area NCBs of their increased subscriptions as a result of the Bank of England’s withdrawal from the European System of Central Banks on 31 January 2020 in connection with the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
Consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem
At the end of 2022 the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises assets and liabilities of the euro area NCBs and the ECB vis-à-vis third parties, stood at €7,956 billion (2021: €8,564 billion). The reduction compared to the previous year was mainly due to the decrease in Eurosystem lending operations as a result of early repayments and maturing of amounts borrowed in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), which was partially offset by higher holdings of monetary policy securities as a result of purchases under the APP and the PEPP.
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes rose by €224 billion to €4,937 billion (2021: €4,713 billion). APP holdings increased by €130 billion to €3,254 billion and PEPP holdings increased by €100 billion to €1,681 billion.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-September 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-September 2022 data refer to 311 banking groups and 2396 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
Some revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-September 2022 data.

New ceiling for remuneration of euro area government deposits to be set at the euro short-term rate (€STR) minus 20 basis points, taking effect on 1 May 2023
Remuneration of deposits held under the Eurosystem reserve management services (ERMS) framework to be adjusted accordingly
Measure aims to provide incentives for a gradual and orderly reduction of such deposits held with the Eurosystem, in order to minimise the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy
Remuneration regime will be monitored and adjusted if necessary
On 8 September 2022 the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits held with the Eurosystem, setting the ceiling for such remuneration at the deposit facility rate or the €STR, whichever was lower, until 30 April 2023. The Governing Council has now decided to adjust the ceiling for the remuneration of such deposits as of 1 May 2023, in order to provide incentives for a gradual and orderly reduction of those holdings, thereby minimising the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy. This decision also alters the remuneration of deposits held under the ERMS framework.
As of 1 May 2023 the ceiling for the remuneration of government deposits will be the €STR minus 20 basis points. This change reflects the fact that, while conditions in the repo market have improved since September 2022, the market remains fragile. There is persistent collateral scarcity in some segments, and banks are still constrained in their ability to intermediate a substantial amount of excess liquidity. Consequently, it is important that these deposits return to the market in a gradual manner in order to minimise the risk of adverse effects on market functioning and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. This decision reflects the desire to encourage market intermediation, with the changes to the remuneration regime providing incentives for depositors to gradually phase out their holdings with the Eurosystem. The Governing Council will continue to monitor money market developments and the evolution of these deposit holdings, and it stands ready to make further adjustments to the remuneration regime if necessary.
The remuneration of deposits held under the ERMS framework will also be adjusted accordingly as of 1 May 2023.
All amendments to legal acts reflecting this new remuneration regime for government deposits will be published before the change takes effect on 1 May 2023.

Compared with November:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead remained unchanged, while expectations for inflation three years ahead edged up;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased, while expectations for nominal spending growth decreased slightly;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months increased, whereas they decreased for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time;
consumer expectations for growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months and expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead remained broadly unchanged.
Inflation
The median rate of perceived inflation over the previous 12 months stood at 9.9% for the third consecutive month. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months were unchanged at 5.0%, while median expectations for inflation three years ahead edged up from 2.9% to 3.0%, reversing their previous decline. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead eased somewhat compared with the levels observed since mid-2022. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70).

Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.0% over the next 12 months, up from 0.9% in November. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months also edged up to 6.4%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months declined further, edging down from 4.3% to 4.2%. Expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) still reporting lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents (aged 55-70).

HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2023 and 2024, but down for longer term
Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged
Unemployment rate expectations revised down
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2023, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for 2023 and 2024. These now stand at 5.9% and 2.7% respectively; 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. The upward revisions reflect corresponding changes to expectations for inflation excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco (HICPX). According to respondents, these changes mainly reflect a combination of recent data outturns, ongoing stronger and broader than expected indirect effects of energy price developments as well as higher forecast wage growth. Expectations for 2025, which were not surveyed in the previous round, stand at 2.1%. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) were revised down by 0.1 percentage points to 2.1% on average.
GDP growth expectations were largely unchanged with positive “carry-over” from stronger than expected economic activity in the second half of 2022 affecting 2023, but being offset by slightly weaker expectations for 2024 than previously reported. Longer-term GDP growth expectations remained unchanged at 1.4%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised down for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points. Following an expected increase to 7.0% in 2023 (the unemployment rate stood at 6.5% in November 2022) the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually to 6.4% by 2027."

ECB details modalities to reduce Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the asset purchase programme through partial reinvestment, broadly in line with current practice under full reinvestment
Governing Council decided on stronger tilting of corporate bond purchases during partial reinvestment, including in primary market, towards issuers with better climate performance
As communicated in December, from the beginning of March 2023, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of June 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions.
On the basis of the December decision, the Governing Council today decided on the detailed modalities for reducing the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under APP through the partial reinvestment of the principal payments from maturing securities.
During the period of partial reinvestment, the Eurosystem will retain the existing smooth reinvestment approach. The monthly redemptions under the APP between March and June 2023 will exceed the decided average run-off pace of €15 billion per month. Partial reinvestments in excess of €15 billion per month will ensure that the Eurosystem maintains a continuous market presence under the APP over this period.
The remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions across each constituent programme of the APP, i.e. the public sector purchase programme (PSPP), the asset-backed securities purchase programme (ABSPP), the third covered bond purchase programme (CBPP3) and the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP).
Under the PSPP, the allocation of the reinvestments across jurisdictions and over time will continue to follow current practice. Specifically, the remaining reinvestment amounts will be allocated proportionally to the share of redemptions of each jurisdiction and across national and supranational issuers. Reinvestments will be distributed over time to allow a regular and balanced market presence.
For the private sector programmes (ABSPP, CBPP3 and CSPP), primary market purchases will be phased out by the start of the partial reinvestments in order to better steer the amount of the purchases conducted under each programme. The Eurosystem’s market presence during the period of partial reinvestment will therefore be focused on secondary market purchases. However, non-bank corporate issuers with a better climate performance and green corporate bonds will continue to be purchased in the primary market.
Finally, the Governing Council decided on a stronger tilting of its corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance during the period of partial reinvestment. Without prejudice to the ECB’s price stability objective, and in keeping with the Governing Council’s climate action plan, this approach will support the gradual decarbonisation of the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Substantial tightening in credit standards for all loan categories
Loan demand from firms decreased as interest rates continued to rise and financing needs for fixed investment fell
Demand for housing loans decreased strongly owing to rising interest rates, low consumer confidence and deteriorating housing market prospects
According to the January 2023 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened substantially further (net percentage of banks standing at 26%) in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1). Looking at developments from a historical perspective, the net tightening in credit standards was the largest reported since the euro area sovereign debt crisis in 2011. With regard to loans to households for house purchase and consumer credit and other lending to households, banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 21% and 17% respectively). Higher risk perceptions related to the economic outlook and industry or firm-specific situation, banks’ declining risk tolerance as well as higher cost of funds continued to have a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms. In the first quarter of 2023 euro area banks expect a continued net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms. In addition, euro area banks expect another net tightening of credit standards for both housing loans and consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts – tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the fourth quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, margins on riskier and average loans, collateral requirements and other terms and conditions had a tightening effect. For housing loans and consumer credit, the net tightening of terms and conditions was primarily due to a widening of margins on both average and riskier loans.
Banks reported a net decrease in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the fourth quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Banks indicated a significant negative contribution of the rising general level of interest rates to loan demand. In addition, fixed investment had a stronger dampening impact on loan demand. Banks reported a positive impact of inventories and working capital needs on demand for loans to firms, although its contribution was smaller than in the previous two quarters, which likely reflects the gradual easing of supply bottlenecks.
The decrease in net demand for housing loans was the strongest on record, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households also decreased strongly in net terms, albeit to a lesser extent than for housing loans. The net decrease in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates, lower consumer confidence and deteriorating housing market prospects. In the first quarter of 2023, banks expect a further net decline in demand for loans to firms. For loans to households, banks expect a continued strong net decline in demand for the first quarter of 2023.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding and securitisation deteriorated moderately in the fourth quarter of 2022, while access to debt securities and money markets improved slightly. Euro area banks reported a strengthening of their capital position in 2022 in response to new regulatory or supervisory requirements, although to a smaller extent than in 2021. At the same time, supervisory or regulatory action had a net tightening impact on banks’ credit standards across all loan categories in 2022. In the second half of 2022, euro area banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios had a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises and households, while they had a slight tightening impact on terms and conditions for loans to enterprises, and a broadly neutral impact on terms and conditions for loans to households. Euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises across the main economic sectors in the second half of 2022. In addition, banks reported a net decrease in the demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, while for the energy-intensive manufacturing sub-sector there was a small increase in demand.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the January 2023 survey relate to changes observed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the first quarter of 2023, unless otherwise indicated. The January 2023 survey round was conducted between 12 December 2022 and 10 January 2023. A total of 151 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 99%.

376,000 counterfeit euro banknotes withdrawn from circulation in 2022, second-lowest level ever in proportion to total banknotes in circulation
Around two-thirds of withdrawn counterfeits were €20 and €50 banknotes
Euro banknotes remain trusted and safe means of payment
Authenticity of euro banknotes verified using “feel, look and tilt” method
Some 376,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2022. There is little likelihood of receiving a counterfeit, as the number of counterfeits remains very low in proportion to the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation. In 2022 13 counterfeits were detected per million genuine banknotes in circulation, which is the second-smallest proportion since the introduction of euro banknotes (see the chart below).
Despite this exceptionally small proportion, the number of counterfeits increased by 8.4% compared with 2021 (see Table 1), when the proportion of counterfeits was at its lowest since the euro was introduced. This increase also reflects the recovery of economic activity in 2022 after most coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions had been lifted. €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, together accounting for slightly below two-thirds of the total (see Table 2). 96.6% of the counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 2.7% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 0.7% in other parts of the world.
Most counterfeits are easy to detect as they have no security features, or only very poor imitations of such features. The public does not need to be concerned about counterfeiting but should remain vigilant. Notes can be checked using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described on the dedicated security features webpage and on the websites of the euro area national central banks. The Eurosystem also helps professional cash handlers by ensuring that successfully tested machines for handling and processing banknotes can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation.
Using counterfeits for payment is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution. If you receive a suspicious banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed, please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem actively supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting.

New experimental and analytical indicators to help analyse climate-related risks in financial sector and monitor green transition
ECB and national central banks to further improve indicators to match quality standards of official ECB statistics
Initial experimental statistics show increasing share of euro area debt securities labelled as green or sustainable
The European Central Bank (ECB) has published a first set of climate-related statistical indicators
[
1
]
today to better assess the impact of climate-related risks on the financial sector and to monitor the development of sustainable and green finance, fulfilling another of the commitments of its climate action plan.
“We need a better understanding of how climate change will affect the financial sector, and vice versa. For this, the development of high-quality data is key,” says Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel. “The indicators are a first step to help narrow the climate data gap, which is crucial to make further progress towards a climate-neutral economy.”
The new indicators are either experimental or analytical. Experimental data comply with many, but not all, of the quality requirements of official ECB statistics.
[
2
]
Analytical data have a lower quality and certain – sometimes significant – limitations.
The indicators are, therefore, a work in progress and should be used with caution. They are intended to start a broader conversation within the statistical and research community and with other key stakeholders on how to better capture data on climate-related risks and the green transition. The ECB, together with the national central banks, will work to improve the methodology and the data used. New data sources, expected to become available in line with EU initiatives on climate-related disclosures and reporting, will help in this respect.
To ensure the indicators are accessible and replicable, they use existing data from the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) or other, publicly available, data whenever possible. Specifically, the indicators cover three areas:
Experimental indicators on sustainable finance provide an overview of debt instruments labelled as “green”, “social”, “sustainability” or “sustainability-linked” by the issuer that are issued or held in the euro area. The data show that the volume of sustainable and green bonds has more than doubled over the last two years and grew much faster than the overall euro area bond market. Besides boosting transparency, these indicators also help track progress on the transition to a net-zero economy. That said, the lack of internationally accepted and harmonised standards on what defines a green or sustainable bond makes the data less reliable overall.
Analytical indicators on carbon emissions financed by financial institutions provide information on the carbon intensity of the securities and loan portfolios of financial institutions, and on the financial sector’s exposure to counterparties with carbon-intensive business models. Preliminary results show that in the euro area, most of the emissions financed via equity or bonds are held by investment funds. However, the data suggest that the most carbon-intensive activities are financed via the banking sector, as the companies they finance produce relatively more emissions in their business operations to achieve a given level of revenue.
Analytical indicators on climate-related physical risks analyse the impact of natural hazards, such as floods, wildfires or storms, on the performance of loans, bonds and equities portfolios. While the risk of windstorms broadly affects financial portfolios in the euro area, the risk of this hazard causing severe damage is rather low. In contrast, floods are limited to coastal and river areas but are estimated to have a higher level of damages and losses.
In July 2022 the ECB published a detailed climate action plan on how to incorporate climate change considerations into its monetary policy framework. In October 2022 it started tilting its corporate bond holdings towards issuers with a better climate performance. Today’s publication of new climate-related indicators is another step towards delivering on the ECB’s climate commitments.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to investment funds in particular, mainly attributed to deterioration in market liquidity and functioning
Increased overall demand for funding and demand for funding with maturity greater than 30 days in context of deteriorating liquidity conditions for most collateral types
Market participants expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for almost all types of debt securities and for derivatives
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened over the September-November 2022 review period across all counterparty types. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparty types, but in particular for investment funds. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions − mainly attributed to a deterioration in market liquidity and functioning − continued the trend reported for the previous six quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the September 2022 survey. Overall credit terms are expected to tighten further over the review period from December 2022 to February 2023. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased during the September-November 2022 review period, continuing a development reported since the March 2022 SESFOD, while the use of financial leverage decreased for investment funds.
In the case of securities financing transactions, the maximum amount of funding offered against collateral in the form of euro-denominated collateral, on balance, decreased for convertible securities in particular but also for high-quality corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and covered bonds. As for the maximum maturity of funding, respondents reported a mixed picture. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral either increased or remained unchanged, while financing rates/spreads increased for financing secured against all collateral types except convertible securities and equities. Survey respondents reported an increased overall demand for funding and demand for funding with a maturity greater than 30 days. The liquidity of all collateral types continued to deteriorate, with the largest percentage of respondents reporting a decrease in the liquidity of high-yield corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, survey respondents reported that initial margin requirements for most OTC derivatives increased during the September-November 2022 review period, but reported only limited changes with respect to the other questions on non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives.
The December 2022 survey included a number of special questions about market-making activities. Survey respondents reported that market-making activities had decreased or remained unchanged for all types of debt securities except domestic government bonds and had increased for derivatives over the past year. They expected market-making activities to broadly increase in 2023. Respondents cited profitability of market-making activities as the main driver of a decrease in market-making activities over the last year. They identified the willingness to take on risk and the availability of balance sheet or capital as the main drivers of expected changes in market-making activities in the year ahead.
Respondents expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for almost all types of debt securities – except high-yield corporate bonds – and for derivatives. They thereby broadly confirmed their assessment of the past two years – with the important exception of asset-backed securities and high-yield corporate bonds, for which they expressed very low confidence. Willingness to take on risk remained the main reason for banks’ confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress.
The December 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The December 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between September 2022 and November 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Compared with October:
consumer inflation expectations 12 months and three years ahead declined;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months increased, while expectations for nominal spending growth decreased;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months increased, whereas expectations for the unemployment rate in 12 months’ time decreased;
consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain broadly unchanged, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. The prolonged rise in perceived inflation over the previous 12 months came to a halt, with the median rate remaining at 9.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months decreased from 5.4% to 5.0%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead edged down from 3.0% to 2.9%. Uncertainty about inflation expectations 12 months ahead has been stable since July, although it remains well above the level prevailing before the war in Ukraine. Inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Inflation results)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.9% over the next 12 months, up from 0.7% in October. For the first time since mid-2021, expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months decreased – from 4.7% to 4.3%. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months remained unchanged at 6.3%. Expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, with younger respondents (aged 18-34) again reporting lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months increased from -2.6% in October to -2.0%. Consistent with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead edged down to 12.4%, compared with 12.5% in October. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.8%). Both the expected and the perceived unemployment rates were highest for the lowest income quintile. (Labour market and economic growth results)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain fairly stable at 3.1%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.8%, 1.5 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Following the tightening reported in October, perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and expectations for access to credit over the next 12 months both loosened again.

Euro banknotes and coins start circulating in Croatia
Hrvatska narodna banka joins Eurosystem
Croatia becomes 20th euro area member
Hrvatska narodna banka now also full member of Single Supervisory Mechanism following period of close cooperation
The euro entered into circulation in Croatia today, bringing the number of European Union (EU) Member States using the single European currency to 20.
“I welcome Croatia to the euro family and to the ECB Governing Council table in Frankfurt” said Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank. “Croatia worked hard to become the twentieth member of the euro area, and it succeeded. I congratulate the Croatian people. It shows the euro is an attractive currency which brings stability to its members.”
With Croatia joining the euro area, Hrvatska narodna banka, the country’s national central bank, becomes a member of the Eurosystem. The euro area’s central banking system comprises the ECB and the national central banks of those countries whose currency is the euro.
Hrvatska narodna banka also becomes a full member of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, although the country has been part of the close cooperation framework since October 2020. As such, the ECB is currently responsible for directly supervising five significant institutions in the country and overseeing 16 less significant institutions there. As part of its supervisory tasks, the ECB is also responsible for licensing banks and assessing the buyers of qualifying holdings in all banks. Hrvatska narodna banka already has a representative on the ECB’s Supervisory Board.
Hrvatska narodna banka has paid the remainder of its contribution to the capital of the ECB and transferred its contribution to the ECB’s foreign reserve assets. Croatian counterparties of the Eurosystem will be able to participate in ECB open market operations announced after 1 January 2023. A list of credit institutions and branches of credit institutions located in Croatia that are subject to reserve requirements will be published shortly on the ECB’s website, as will lists of branches of Croatian credit institutions located in other EU Member States already using the euro. The ECB announced transitional provisions for minimum reserve requirements on 28 October 2022. Assets located in Croatia that fulfil the necessary requirements will be added to the euro area’s list of eligible collateral.
Croatia joining the euro area as its 20th member also means that the new system of rotating voting rights in the ECB’s Governing Council comes into force as of today, with the rights rotating according to a calendar.
Croatia’s membership of the euro area has also led to changes to the Eurosystem capital subscriptions.

Haircut schedules for assets used as collateral in monetary policy operations to be updated with effect from 29 June 2023
Measures aim to ensure adequate level of risk protection, improve consistency of framework and enhance risk equivalence of assets, while ensuring collateral availability
Measures based on ECB’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels for credit operations
The European Central Bank (ECB) today announced the results of the most recent review of its risk control framework for collateralised credit operations. On 24 March 2022 the Governing Council announced its decision to gradually phase out the pandemic collateral easing measures. The ECB also communicated that it would implement a new valuation haircut schedule for credit operations based on its pre-pandemic risk tolerance levels. Following the review, the ECB decided on several measures to improve the overall consistency of the risk control framework which will take effect from 29 June 2023. The measures include the following:
Increase the valuation haircuts for marketable and non-marketable assets to return to the ECB’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance level, based on an updated risk assessment.
Re-assign debt instruments issued by the European Union (EU bonds) from haircut category II to haircut category I, the same as used for debt instruments issued by central governments. This reflects the higher liquidity of EU bonds as a result of issuances under the NextGenerationEU and Support to mitigate Unemployment Risk in an Emergency (SURE) instruments.
Phase out the distinction between jumbo and other covered bonds, assigning all covered bonds and multi-cédulas to haircut category II.
Set the haircuts for marketable assets with a floating coupon to be equal to those with a fixed coupon.
Split the longest residual maturity category in the existing haircut schedule into three new categories.
Replace the current flat 5% theoretical valuation markdown with a maturity-graduated markdown schedule, extending its application to all theoretically valued marketable assets except those falling under haircut category I.
The ECB regularly reviews the framework to ensure an adequate level of risk protection and to achieve risk equivalence across asset classes. Following the Governing Council’s July 2022 decision to consider climate change risks when reviewing haircuts, from this review onwards the analysis also aims to ensure the resilience of the haircuts to climate-related financial risks. The present review did not find empirical evidence that necessitates amendments to the haircut schedule based on climate change considerations, as the updated haircut schedule is already sufficiently protective against climate-related financial risks.
The amendments to Guidelines ECB/2014/60, ECB/2015/35 and ECB/2014/31 reflecting the aforementioned measures will be made available on the ECB’s website and will be published in all official EU languages in the Official Journal of the European Union in April 2023.

Cash still used for most consumer payments, but share declines further
Share of electronic payments grows further, including day-to-day online purchases
Consumers prefer electronic payment methods, but value having cash as an option
Cash is still the most frequently used means of payment at the point of sale, but its share is declining according to the latest study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area, published today by the European Central Bank (ECB). Cash was used for 59% of point-of-sale transactions in 2022, down from 72% in 2019. It is the means of payment most often used for small-value payments in stores and for person-to-person transactions. A majority (60%) also consider it important to have cash as a payment option. Consumers perceive cash as helpful to remain aware of their expenditures, to protect their privacy and to allow transactions to be settled immediately. Overall, consumers are satisfied with their access to cash, with a large majority of consumers finding it easy to get to an ATM or a bank to withdraw cash in most countries.
At the same time, the trend towards electronic means of payments has accelerated with the pandemic and a majority of consumers now prefer to use electronic payment methods. The share of online purchases as a percentage of all euro area day-to-day transactions has increased significantly to stand at 17% in 2022, up from 6% in 2019. For purchases at a point of sale, the share of card payments has grown by 9 percentage points to 34% in 2022, with contactless payments now making up the majority of card payments. Cards are considered faster and easier to use and are seen as reducing the need to carry large amounts of cash. Cards are the most frequently used payment method for larger payments and account now for a higher share of payments than cash in value terms.
“The ECB is committed to ensuring that consumers remain free to choose how to pay, both now and in the future,” said Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “We are seeing confirmation of strong demand for both cash and digital payments. Our commitment to cash and our ongoing work on a digital euro aims to ensure that paying with public money is always an option.”
The next study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area will be published in 2024.

Governing Council, Executive Board and Supervisory Board members bound by new restrictions on private financial transactions
Among new rules, high-level officials’ investments limited to broadly diversified funds with a medium to long-term perspective
Revised rules enhance accountability and transparency of ECB
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published an enhanced Code of Conduct for all high-level ECB officials. These new rules, prepared by the ECB’s independent Ethics Committee, impose additional restrictions on the private financial transactions of high-level ECB officials, including Governing Council, Executive Board and Supervisory Board members.
“The amendments to our Code of Conduct carry the full support of all high-level ECB officials and are a strong sign of our unwavering commitment to the ECB’s public mission, which is vital to secure the trust of the Europeans we serve,” says ECB President Christine Lagarde. “While the current Code has proven to be solid and effective, the new rules will bring the ECB’s ethics standards to the next level and ensure that we remain among the leading institutions in this area.”
Under the enhanced rules, high-level ECB officials must limit their investments to publicly listed, broadly diversified collective investment schemes such as exchange-traded funds and mutual funds. A collective investment scheme is considered broadly diversified if it is not concentrated in a specific sector. Asset classes that are already held and that, following the amendments, do not fall into this category may be kept as legacy assets. This means that no further purchases of these assets are allowed and that any sales of such assets would require the prior approval of the ECB’s Ethics Committee.
To further improve transparency, high-level officials will also publicly disclose all financial transactions undertaken during the last calendar year. This information will be published yearly on the ECB’s website, together with the Declarations of Interests. In the case of spouses and minor children, financial transactions above €10,000 during the last calendar year will be reported to the ECB’s Ethics Committee.
The enhanced rules also reinforce the principle of a medium to long-term investment horizon by extending the holding period for all assets from one month to at least one year and introducing a requirement of at least 30 days’ advance notice for transactions exceeding €50,000.
The new rules and principles aim to mitigate the risks of misuse of confidential information and possible conflicts of interest. The amendments to the rules for private financial transactions tighten the current regime with the aim of enhancing the ECB’s accountability and transparency.
The revised rules will apply from 1 January 2023 and will remain applicable to all high-level ECB officials for six months beyond the end of their term of office.
For media queries, please contact Clara Martín Marqués, tel.: +49 173 3790591.
Notes
The Code of Conduct for high-level ECB officials covers the members of the Governing Council, the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, the General Council, the Audit Committee, the Ethics Committee and the Administrative Board of Review. It was first introduced in January 2019 and guides the management of possible conflicts of interest by introducing specific rules for post-employment activities, private financial transactions and relationships with interest groups. It also requires the publication of Declarations of Interests and monthly calendars, and it includes measures for pursuing cases of non-compliance."

ECB extends existing repo and swap lines with non-euro area central banks to 15 January 2024
Euro liquidity lines address possible liquidity needs in view of the economic and geopolitical situation and implications for financial markets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
The Governing Council of the ECB has decided to extend its temporary swap line with Poland as well as its temporary repo lines with the central banks of Albania, Andorra, Hungary, North Macedonia, Romania and San Marino. The size and operational parameters of the individual agreements will remain unchanged.
The swap and repo lines were due to expire on 15 January 2023 and are now extended until 15 January 2024. In the context of the persistent uncertainty stemming from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine and the associated economic and financial repercussions on the global economy and financial markets, the lines are designed to prevent spillover effects in euro area financial markets and economies and safeguard the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy.
These bilateral swap and repo lines have been established since 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions via non-euro area central banks in view of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These temporary agreements complement the ECB’s standing swap lines and EUREP repo agreements. The EUREP facility was extended to 15 January 2024 as part of the ECB’s decisions communicated on 2 December 2022.
Under a repo line, a non-euro area central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral. Under a swap line, a non-euro area central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for its own currency, which is provided as collateral.

The Governing Council today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points and, based on the substantial upward revision to the inflation outlook, expects to raise them further. In particular, the Governing Council judges that interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace to reach levels that are sufficiently restrictive to ensure a timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target. Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The Governing Council’s future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach.
The key ECB interest rates are the Governing Council’s primary tool for setting the monetary policy stance. The Governing Council today also discussed principles for normalising the Eurosystem’s monetary policy securities holdings. From the beginning of March 2023 onwards, the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
At its February meeting the Governing Council will announce the detailed parameters for reducing the APP holdings. The Governing Council will regularly reassess the pace of the APP portfolio reduction to ensure it remains consistent with the overall monetary policy strategy and stance, to preserve market functioning, and to maintain firm control over short-term money market conditions. By the end of 2023, the Governing Council will also review its operational framework for steering short-term interest rates, which will provide information regarding the endpoint of the balance sheet normalisation process.
The Governing Council decided to raise interest rates today, and expects to raise them significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above the target for too long. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, inflation was 10.0% in November, slightly lower than the 10.6% recorded in October. The decline resulted mainly from lower energy price inflation. Food price inflation and underlying price pressures across the economy have strengthened and will persist for some time. Amid exceptional uncertainty, Eurosystem staff have significantly revised up their inflation projections. They now see average inflation reaching 8.4% in 2022 before decreasing to 6.3% in 2023, with inflation expected to decline markedly over the course of the year. Inflation is then projected to average 3.4% in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to be 3.9% on average in 2022 and to rise to 4.2% in 2023, before falling to 2.8% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025.
The euro area economy may contract in the current quarter and the next quarter, owing to the energy crisis, high uncertainty, weakening global economic activity and tighter financing conditions. According to the latest Eurosystem staff projections, a recession would be relatively short-lived and shallow. Growth is nonetheless expected to be subdued next year and has been revised down significantly compared with the previous projections. Beyond the near term, growth is projected to recover as the current headwinds fade. Overall, the Eurosystem staff projections now see the economy growing by 3.4% in 2022, 0.5% in 2023, 1.9% in 2024 and 1.8% in 2025.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. Accordingly, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will be increased to 2.50%, 2.75% and 2.00% respectively, with effect from 21 December 2022.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP until the end of February 2023. Subsequently, the APP portfolio will decline at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem will not reinvest all of the principal payments from maturing securities. The decline will amount to €15 billion per month on average until the end of the second quarter of 2023 and its subsequent pace will be determined over time.
As concerns the PEPP, the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The Governing Council will continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
As banks are repaying the amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, the Governing Council will regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term. The Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today."

Compared with September:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead increased further, while expectations for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged;
inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years;
expectations for both nominal spending and income growth over the next 12 months increased, and expected spending growth continued to outpace expected income growth;
expectations for economic growth over the next 12 months declined, whereas for unemployment in 12 months’ time they increased;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow less over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to rise, with the median rate now standing at 9.9%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased from 5.1% to 5.4%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead were unchanged at 3.0%. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged up, remaining well above the level that prevailed before the start of the war in Ukraine. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, but younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (aged 55-70). (Check out the inflation results)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.7% over the next 12 months, up from 0.6% in September, while expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months also rose notably from 5.7% to 6.3%. Consumers’ expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups; younger respondents (aged 18-34) continued to report lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Check out the income and consumption results)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined from -2.4% in September to -2.6%. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead rose to 12.5%, up from 12.2% in September. Consumers continued to expect the future unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.7%). However, survey data available at a quarterly frequency showed that in October unemployed respondents raised their expected probability of finding a job in the next three months to 27.9%, up from 27.3% in July. Employed respondents, in turn, slightly reduced their expected probability of losing their job in the next three months to 9.2%, down from 9.4% in July. (Check out the labour market and growth results)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected the growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to slow to 3.0% from 3.4% in September. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.7%, 1.4 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations of access to credit over the next 12 months tightened significantly. However, the share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed quarterly, increased to 13.9% in October, up from 12.2% in July 2022.

Euro area firms saw continued improvement in business activity, but rising costs of materials, energy and labour weighed on their profitability. Turnover is still expected to increase over the next six months, but by less than had been expected in the previous survey round.
Lack of skilled labour and higher input costs were reported as the main concerns for firms of all sizes.
The financing gap widened, especially for large firms, as financing needs increased while the availability of external funds declined slightly. A rise in price terms and conditions of bank loans was reported by the highest number of firms since the survey started in 2009.
Despite tighter financing conditions, firms were not particularly concerned about their access to finance and reported no changes in banks’ willingness to lend. However, they expect the availability of external financing to deteriorate and anticipate that their internal funds will not be sufficient to meet their future financing needs.
In the latest round of the biannual Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, covering the period from April to September 2022, firms reported that business activity continued to improve, with increases in turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1). However, production costs surged and the net percentage
[

of firms reporting an increase in the cost of raw materials and energy reached 93%, while an increase in labour costs was reported by a net 71% of firms. Both of these figures stand at new historical peaks – for the second survey round in a row. Owing to the rise in costs, profitability weakened, with both SMEs (net -19%) and large firms (-9%) reporting a decline in profits.
In this survey round, euro area firms signalled an increased need for financing across instruments, while indicating that their availability decreased. This resulted in a net 9% of firms reporting a widening of the financing gap. In terms of size classes, a wider financing gap was reported more often by larger companies (11%) than by SMEs (7%) (Chart 2). In addition, euro area firms reported a tightening of financing conditions, with a net 71% citing higher bank interest rates (up from 34% in the previous round) and a net 49% indicating a deterioration in other terms and conditions (i.e. charges, fees and commissions) (Chart 3). Comparable levels have not been observed in the SAFE since 2011. These developments are consistent with the euro area Bank Lending Survey for the second and third quarters of 2022, which indicate a tightening of collateral requirements and other terms and conditions, as well as a widening of margins applied to bank loans. Although firms in the SAFE indicated a substantial tightening of financing conditions, they reported no changes in banks’ willingness to provide credit. The net percentage of firms reporting obstacles to obtaining a bank loan remained broadly unchanged at 7%. Euro area firms expect a further deterioration in the availability of external financing in the coming six months, as well as a reduced capacity to meet their financing needs with internal funds.
This report published today presents the main results of the 27th round of the SAFE in the euro area, which was conducted between 7 September and 14 October 2022 and covers the period from April to September 2022. The sample comprised 10,984 firms, of which 10,006 (91.1%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Changes in the income situation of euro area enterprises
(net percentages of respondents)
Base: All enterprises. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022) for all firms and to rounds 20-27 (October 2018-March 2019 to April 2022-September 2022) for SMEs and large firms.
Note: Net percentages are the difference between the percentage of enterprises reporting an increase for a given factor and the percentage reporting a decrease.
Chart 2
Changes in the external financing gaps reported by euro area enterprises
(weighted net balances)
Base: Enterprises for which the instrument in question is relevant (i.e. they have used it or considered using it). Respondents replying with “not applicable” or “don’t know” are excluded. The figures refer to rounds 3-27 of the survey (March 2010-September 2010 to April 2022-September 2022).
Notes: The financing gap indicator combines both financing needs and the availability of bank loans, credit lines, trade credit, and equity and debt securities issuance at firm level. For each of the five financing instruments, the indicator of the perceived change in the financing gap takes a value of 1 (-1) if the need increases (decreases) and availability decreases (increases). If enterprises perceive only a one-sided increase (decrease) in the financing gap, the variable is assigned a value of 0.5 (-0.5). The composite indicator is a weighted average of the financing gaps for the five instruments. A positive value for the indicator points to an increase in the financing gap. Values are multiplied by 100 to obtain weighted net balances in percentages.

Launch of Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) rescheduled from 20 November 2023 to 8 April 2024
Additional time will help mitigate impact of rescheduled T2 launch
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has decided to reschedule the launch of the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) from 20 November 2023 to 8 April 2024. This decision was taken to mitigate the impact of the rescheduled launch of T2, the Eurosystem’s new real-time gross settlement system and central liquidity management model, which was postponed by four months on 20 October 2022.
The ECMS will be a unified system for managing assets used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. It will replace the existing individual systems of the euro area national central banks. The ECMS is expected to deliver considerable benefits to the Eurosystem and its counterparties and to the market at large by harmonising collateral management practices and contributing to further EU financial integration.

Households and firms face multiple challenges, including weakening economic outlook, higher inflation and tighter financial conditions
Diminished market liquidity raises risk of disorderly asset price adjustments, which could test investment fund resilience
Governments should ensure support to vulnerable sectors is targeted and does not interfere with monetary policy normalisation
Risks to financial stability in the euro area have increased amid soaring energy prices, elevated inflation and low economic growth, the November 2022 Financial Stability Review published today by the European Central Bank (ECB) shows. At the same time, financial conditions have tightened as central banks act to rein in inflation.
“People and firms are already feeling the impact of rising inflation and the slowdown in economic activity,” said ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos. “Our assessment is that risks to financial stability have increased, while a technical recession in the euro area has become more likely.”
These recent developments are increasing the vulnerability of households, firms and governments that hold more debt. They are also adding to financial market stresses and testing the resilience of investment funds. Moreover, all of these vulnerabilities could unfold simultaneously, potentially reinforcing one another.
Corporate sector challenges have grown amid higher energy and other input costs, with profits expected to decline as funding costs increase. If the outlook deteriorates further, an increase in the frequency of corporate defaults cannot be excluded, particularly among energy-intensive firms.
Inflation, as well as soaring gas and electricity bills, is also hitting households, decreasing their purchasing power and potentially reducing their ability to repay loans. Lower-income households that generally spend a greater share of their income on energy and food are particularly affected.
As firms and households find it increasingly challenging to service their debts, banks could face higher credit losses in the medium term. While the banking sector has recently seen a recovery in profitability as interest rates have risen, there are incipient signs of asset quality deterioration, which may require larger provisions.
Many governments have been providing fiscal support to firms and households to soften the impact of rising energy prices. However, high levels of government debt following the pandemic, paired with tighter funding conditions, limit the scope for fiscal expansion measures that do not trigger risks to debt sustainability. Support should therefore be temporary and targeted at those most affected.
Uncertainty around the outlook for inflation and interest rates has heightened the risk of disorderly asset price adjustment in financial markets, notwithstanding recent corrections. Many investment funds remain heavily exposed to further valuation and credit losses. Those with large structural liquidity mismatches and low cash buffers are particularly vulnerable to market dislocations and the outflow of funding. Diminished liquidity in some financial markets could also pose challenges for adjusting portfolios or raising funds. It also raises the risk of unexpectedly large margin calls, which could aggravate adverse market dynamics if funds are forced to sell assets to meet them.
Overall, the euro area banking system is well placed to withstand many risks, in part because of the regulatory and prudential policy reforms of the past decade. Given the deterioration of the economic and financial outlook, targeted macroprudential policies such as capital buffers can help to further strengthen the resilience of the financial system.
Persistent vulnerabilities and risks in the non-bank financial sector require close attention from relevant supervisors. Urgent progress on regulatory frameworks is needed to enhance the resilience of the sector, especially to address liquidity mismatches and leverage.

Compared with August:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months ahead increased slightly, while expectations for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged;
expectations for nominal income growth over the next 12 months declined markedly, while expectations for nominal spending growth remained unchanged;
expectations declined significantly for economic growth over the next 12 months and increased for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected growth in the price of their home over the next 12 months to remain unchanged, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to rise, with the median rate now standing at 8.1%. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Median expectations for inflation over the next 12 months increased from 5.0% to 5.1%, while expectations for inflation three years ahead were unchanged at 3.0%. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged down in September but remained well above the level that prevailed before the start of the war in Ukraine. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations were closely aligned across income groups, while younger respondents (18-34 years) continued to report lower inflation perceptions and expectations than older respondents (55-70 years). (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 0.6% over the next 12 months, down from 1.0% in August. The decline was strongest for older respondents (55-70 years) and households with income around or just below the median. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months edged down to 5.7%. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months remained unchanged at 4.5%. Consumers’ expectations for nominal spending remained broadly aligned across income groups, while younger respondents (18-34 years) continued to report lower expectations for nominal spending than older respondents. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined significantly from -1.7% in August to -2.4%. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead rose to 12.2%, from 11.9% in August. Consumers continued to expect the unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.5%). Expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead were quite well aligned across age groups but were again higher for lower-income respondents (first income quintile) than for higher-income respondents (fifth income quintile), by 3.3 percentage points. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers expected the growth in the price of their homes over the next 12 months to remain at 3.4%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.5%, 1.2 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. While consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months tightened again, their expectations of access to credit over the next 12 months eased slightly.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-June 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-June 2022 data refer to 316 banking groups and 2440 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties, mainly attributed to deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning
Higher maximum amount of funding but shorter maximum maturity against domestic government bonds
Deterioration in liquidity conditions continued for most collateral types
Higher initial margin requirements for most OTC derivative types, especially commodity derivatives
On balance, overall credit terms and conditions tightened over the June-August 2022 review period across all counterparty types. Price terms tightened for all counterparty types, but in particular for banks and dealers, investment funds and hedge funds. Non-price terms tightened for hedge funds and banks and dealers. The overall tightening of credit terms and conditions − mainly attributed to a deterioration in general market liquidity and functioning − continued the trend reported for the previous five quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the June 2022 survey. Overall credit terms are expected to tighten further over the September-November 2022 review period. The amount of resources dedicated to managing concentrated credit exposures increased in the June-August 2022 review period, while the use of financial leverage and the availability of unutilised leverage decreased.
In the case of securities financing transactions, the maximum amount of funding offered against collateral in the form of euro-denominated domestic government bonds increased, while the maximum maturity offered decreased. For other types of collateral, respondents reported a mixed picture. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral either increased or remained unchanged, while financing rates/spreads increased for financing secured against all collateral types. The liquidity of most collateral types continued to deteriorate, with the largest percentage of respondents reporting a decrease in the liquidity of high-yield corporate bonds.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the counter (OTC) derivatives, initial margin requirements for most OTC derivatives, and especially commodity derivatives, increased during the June-August 2022 review period. While liquidity and trading deteriorated somewhat for credit derivatives referencing corporates or structured credit products as well as commodity derivatives and total return swaps, they remained unchanged for all other OTC derivative types. Respondents also reported an increase in the volume, duration and persistence of valuation disputes for OTC commodity derivatives contracts.
The September 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The September 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between June 2022 and August 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Croatia introducing the euro means Croatian banks subject to minimum reserve requirements
Integrating Croatian institutions smoothly into Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system necessitates transitional provisions
On 20 October 2022 the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted a Decision on the application of minimum reserves by the ECB following the introduction of the euro in Croatia on 1 January 2023 (ECB/2022/36).
As of 1 January 2023, credit institutions and branches of credit institutions (hereafter referred to as “institutions”) located in Croatia will be subject to the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve requirements. Given that the regular reserve maintenance period runs from 21 December 2022 to 7 February 2023, transitional provisions are necessary to ensure that the relevant institutions are integrated smoothly into the Eurosystem’s minimum reserve system, without placing a disproportionate burden on institutions located in Croatia.
The Decision, in line with decisions taken when other countries joined the euro area, provides for a transitional maintenance period from 1 January to 7 February 2023 for the imposition of minimum reserve requirements on institutions located in Croatia. Furthermore, the Decision sets out specific rules governing the application of minimum reserve requirements during the transitional period and describes the method for calculating the reserve base in relation to the transitional period for liabilities owed to institutions located in Croatia. In this respect, institutions located in other euro area countries may decide to deduct any liabilities owed to institutions located in Croatia from their reserve base for the maintenance periods from 21 December 2022 to 7 February 2023 and from 8 February to 21 March 2023.
The Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

HICP inflation expectations revised up further for 2022-2024 horizons, but unchanged for the longer term
Real GDP growth expectations revised down
Unemployment rate expectations revised up
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2022, respondents revised up further their inflation expectations for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 horizons. These now stand at 8.3%, 5.8% and 2.4% respectively; 1.0, 1.2 and 0.3 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions primarily reflect a combination of higher (non-oil) energy and food prices as well as their pass-through to other prices and higher forecast wage growth. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood unchanged at 2.2% on average.
GDP growth expectations were revised down substantially for 2023. Respondents now expect activity to broadly stagnate in 2023 (0.1% growth) and expect growth to be negative between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 with a cumulative decline of 0.7%. This is attributed to ongoing high energy price pressures, inflation affecting households’ purchasing power, a weaker global economy and tighter monetary policy. Longer-term growth expectations were revised down marginally to 1.4%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised up for all horizons by between 0.1 and 0.4 percentage points. The profile for the future unemployment rate is hump-shaped with an increase to 7.1% expected in 2023 and a gradual decline thereafter to 6.6% by 2027."

ECB recalibrates third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to ensure consistency with broader monetary policy normalisation process
Recalibration will help address unexpected and extraordinary inflation increases by reinforcing transmission of policy rates to bank lending conditions
From 23 November 2022, interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III operations to be indexed to average applicable key ECB interest rates from that date onward
Existing interest rate calculation maintained for period up to 22 November 2022
Modification accompanied by three additional voluntary early repayment dates introduced for banks wishing to terminate or reduce borrowings before maturity
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) as part of the monetary policy measures adopted to restore price stability over the medium term. In view of the current inflationary developments and outlook, it is necessary to adapt certain parameters of TLTRO III to reinforce the transmission of our policy rates to bank lending conditions so that TLTRO III contributes to the transmission of the monetary policy stance needed to ensure the timely return of inflation to the ECB’s 2% medium-term target.
The recalibration of the TLTRO III terms and conditions will contribute to the normalisation of bank funding costs. The ensuing normalisation of financing conditions, in turn, will exert downward pressure on inflation, contributing to restoring price stability over the medium term. The recalibration also removes deterrents to early voluntary repayment of outstanding TLTRO III funds. Earlier voluntary repayments would reduce the Eurosystem balance sheet and, with that, contribute to the overall monetary policy normalisation.
From 23 November 2022 until the maturity date or early repayment date of each respective outstanding TLTRO III operation, the interest rate on TLTRO III operations will be indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates over this period.
The existing interest rate calculation method will be maintained for the period from the settlement date of each respective TLTRO III operation until 22 November 2022, albeit with indexing to the applicable key ECB interest rates ending on that date.
Furthermore, three additional voluntary early repayment dates will be introduced to provide TLTRO III participants with additional opportunities to partly, or fully, repay their respective TLTRO III borrowings before their maturity.
The first additional voluntary repayment opportunity will coincide with the start of the new interest rate calculation method on 23 November 2022. Counterparties will need to inform their respective national central bank by 16 November 2022 of their intention to use this repayment option. The repayment calendar will be updated on the ECB’s website accordingly.
These changes to the terms and conditions of TLTRO III will apply to all TLTRO III operations still outstanding and will be implemented via a sixth amendment to the Decision of the ECB of 22 July 2019 on a third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/2019/21), as amended by the Decisions of the ECB of 12 September 2019 (ECB/2019/28), 16 March 2020 (ECB/2020/13), 30 April 2020 (ECB/2020/25), 29 January 2021 (ECB/2021/3) and 30 April 2021 (ECB/2021/21). The amendment will shortly be published on the ECB’s website and subsequently in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises at the 2% medium-term target.

Minimum reserves to be remunerated at deposit facility rate
Change better aligns minimum reserves remuneration with money market rates
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR). The change will become effective as of the beginning of the reserve maintenance period starting on 21 December 2022.
Minimum reserves are the average funds that credit institutions are required to hold in their reserve accounts at their national central bank over a maintenance period.
These have until now been remunerated at the ECB’s main refinancing operations (MRO) rate. However, under the prevailing market and liquidity conditions, the DFR better reflects the rate at which funds can be invested in money market instruments if not held as minimum reserves and the rate at which banks borrow funds in the money market to fulfil minimum reserves.
For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.
Notes
The ECB has published explanations of minimum reserves and the deposit facility rate.
Further information on minimum reserves can be found in Regulation (EU) 2021/378 of the European Central Bank of 22 January 2021 on the application of minimum reserve requirements (ECB/2021/1), (OJ L 73, 3.3.2021, p. 1–15)."

Credit standards tightened substantially for households and firms
Loan demand from firms increased, driven by high input costs and inventories building
Loan demand from households decreased in a context of higher interest rates and lower confidence
According to the October 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened further (net percentage of banks standing at 19%) in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 1). With regard to loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 32%) and a lesser, but still pronounced, net tightening for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 21%). In the context of economic slowdown and intensifying recession fears, the risks related to the economic outlook, as well as industry or firm-specific situations and banks’ declining risk tolerance all had a considerable tightening impact on credit standards for loans to firms. With the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy, banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation also had a tightening impact on credit standards for loans to euro area firms, which was larger than in the previous survey round. In the fourth quarter of 2022 euro area banks expect a significantly stronger net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms. In addition, euro area banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for both housing loans and consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the third quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, both loan margins and other terms and conditions had a tightening effect. For house purchase loans and consumer credit, despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, loan margins (with margins defined as the spread over relevant market reference rates) narrowed, reflecting in part that market reference rates have increased faster than interest rates on loans to households.
Banks reported, on balance, an increase in demand from firms for loans or drawing of credit lines in the third quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital and inventories, in the context of inflated production costs, growing inventories due to the slowdown in demand and precautionary behaviour against the background of supply bottlenecks. For the second consecutive quarter, fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, in line with the expected slowdown in investment. In the context of monetary policy normalisation, banks have started to indicate a negative contribution from the general level of interest rates to loan demand. In the third quarter of 2022 net demand for housing loans fell substantially, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households also decreased in net terms. The net decrease in demand for loans to households was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates and declining consumer confidence. For the fourth quarter of 2022 banks expect a net decrease in firms’ demand for loans. For households, banks expect a further strong net decrease in the demand for housing loans and a lesser, but still relatively strong, fall in demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding, securitisation and particularly medium-to-long term debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the third quarter of 2022. This reflects the tightening of financial market conditions for banks as monetary policy normalises. Banks reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes had a negative impact on their liquidity position, market financing conditions and profitability over the past six months, in the context of the monetary policy normalisation and the ending of net asset purchases. Over the past six months, which partly covered the period in which the ECB’s deposit facility rate was still negative, euro area banks reported in net terms, that the deposit facility rate continued to have a positive, albeit small, impact on lending volumes to firms and households and continued to contribute negatively to bank profitability. Banks in the euro area indicated a smaller positive impact from TLTRO III on their financial situation and lending volumes, as well as a lower net easing impact on terms and conditions for loans to firms and households compared with the previous survey round.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the October 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the third quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the fourth quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The October 2022 survey round was conducted between 16 September and 4 October 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Launch of new real-time gross settlement system and T2 rescheduled from 21 November 2022 to 20 March 2023
Additional four-month period ensures greater system stability and user readiness, as well as smooth transition to new platform
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to reschedule the launch of the new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system and its central liquidity management model, T2. The go-live has therefore been postponed by four months, from 21 November 2022 to 20 March 2023. The decision, following an assessment by the ECB’s Market Infrastructure Board, was driven by the need to allow users more time to complete their testing in a stable environment. The decision also took into account the importance and systemic nature of T2, especially in view of the current geopolitical conditions and volatile financial markets.
While most users would have been ready for the scheduled go-live date, others would not have fully completed their testing. Delays encountered by market participants were also due to the temporary unavailability of the test environment and initial software deficiencies.
The Eurosystem will provide all the necessary support to market participants during their final preparations. Market participants that have not completed their testing successfully are encouraged to front-load their testing efforts in the additional period provided.
The consolidated platform brings together the RTGS system and the securities settlement platform run by the Eurosystem, thus contributing to the further harmonisation of European financial markets. It also unifies the technical and functional aspects of the TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities platforms and introduces new common and optimised features. In addition, RTGS will replace TARGET2 and optimise liquidity management across all TARGET Services. Four central banks (Deutsche Bundesbank, Banca d’Italia, Banque de France and Banco de España) act as service providers for TARGET Services. They are delivering the software and providing the test environment for the T2-T2S consolidation project.

ECB and People’s Bank of China extend bilateral euro-renminbi currency swap arrangement for another three years
Swap arrangement has maximum size of CNY 350 billion and €45 billion
Arrangement serves as backstop liquidity facility to address shortages of Chinese renminbi of euro area banks
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) have decided to extend their bilateral euro-renminbi currency swap arrangement for another three years until 8 October 2025. The conditions of the arrangement remain essentially unchanged.
The ECB and the PBC established the first three-year bilateral currency swap arrangement on 8 October 2013, with a maximum size of CNY 350 billion and €45 billion. This was subsequently extended in 2016 and 2019, each time for a further three-year period.
From a Eurosystem perspective, the arrangement serves as a backstop facility to address potential sudden and temporary CNY liquidity shortages for euro area banks as a result of disruptions in the renminbi market. Liquidity-providing arrangements contribute to global financial stability. The arrangement with the PBC is consistent with the large volumes of bilateral trade and investment between the euro area and China.

Compared with July:
consumer expectations for inflation 12 months and three years ahead remained unchanged;
expectations for nominal income and spending growth over the next 12 months increased;
expectations rose slightly for economic growth over the next 12 months and edged down for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow slightly more over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to increase, with the median rate now standing at 8.0%, up from 7.9% in July. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, particularly at the medium-term horizon of three years. Both the median expectation for inflation over the next 12 months and the median expectation for inflation three years ahead remained unchanged at 5.0% and 3.0% respectively. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead was stable in August compared with July. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations across income groups were aligned. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their nominal income to grow by 1.0% over the next 12 months, up from 0.8% in July. The improvement in expected nominal income growth was broad-based across income groups, except for respondents in the first quintile, who expected lower nominal income growth. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months continued to increase, reaching a new high of 5.8%, up from 5.4% in July. The largest increases came from higher-income respondents. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose further to reach 4.5%, up from 4.2% in July, owing to the increases anticipated by lower- and middle-income respondents.

Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months increased slightly from -1.9% in July to -1.7%. Consistent with the higher expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead were a notch down at 11.9%. Nonetheless, consumers continued to expect the unemployment rate to be higher than the perceived current unemployment rate (11.5%). (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. After a decline in July, consumers slightly raised their expectations for the growth in the price of their homes over the next 12 months to 3.4%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead increased further to 4.4% and now stand 1.1 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations over the next 12 months tightened slightly again. (Link to Housing and credit access results and charts)

Decarbonisation to be based on issuer-specific climate score
Corporate bond holdings to be tilted towards issuers with better scores
Tilting to be applied to all corporate bond purchases settled as of 1 October 2022
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published further details on how it aims to gradually decarbonise the corporate bond holdings in its monetary policy portfolios, on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. One goal is to reduce the Eurosystem’s exposure to climate-related financial risk, following the Governing Council’s July 2022 decision to tilt the Eurosystem’s corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance. Furthermore, these measures support the green transition of the economy in line with the EU’s climate neutrality objectives.
The overall climate score that will be used to tilt bond holdings combines the following three sub-scores:
1. The backward-looking emissions sub-score is based on issuers’ past emissions. It looks at how companies perform compared with their peers in a specific sector as well as compared with all eligible bond issuers. Those performing better receive a better score.
2. The forward-looking target sub-score is based on the objectives set by issuers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Companies with more ambitious decarbonisation targets receive a better score. This incentivises them to reduce their emissions.
3. The climate disclosure sub-score is based on the assessment of issuers’ reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Those issuers with high-quality disclosures receive a better score. This incentivises bond issuers to improve their climate-related disclosures.
Issuers’ climate scores will affect their relative weighting in the benchmark guiding the Eurosystem’s ongoing reinvestment purchases of corporate bonds. This will result in the purchase of more bonds issued by companies with a good climate performance and fewer bonds from those with a poor climate performance. Additionally, the Eurosystem will use the climate score to adjust its bids on the primary market to favour issuers with a better climate performance and to impose maturity limits on bonds from lower-scoring issuers.
The Eurosystem will take the climate score into account in all purchases of corporate bonds – whether under the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) or the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) – settled as of 1 October 2022. The overall volume of corporate bond purchases will continue to be determined solely by monetary policy considerations. The eligibility criteria for corporate bond purchases remain unchanged at this point.
The climate scores and the methodology used to calculate them will be reviewed regularly and may evolve to account for new developments in terms of data, models, regulation and risk assessment capabilities.
The ECB will start publishing climate-related information on its corporate bond holdings as of the first quarter of 2023 and will regularly report on the progress towards alignment with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Tilting the Eurosystem’s corporate bond holdings as of October 2022 will mark the achievement of another milestone in the ECB climate action plan announced in July 2021. The ECB-wide climate agenda provides an overview of all ongoing climate-related activities.

Ceiling for remuneration of government deposits to remain at deposit facility rate (DFR) or euro short-term rate (€STR), whichever is lower, until 30 April 2023
Measure aims to preserve effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning
To preserve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and safeguard orderly market functioning, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) today decided to temporarily remove the 0% interest rate ceiling for remunerating government deposits. Instead, the ceiling will temporarily remain at the lower of either the Eurosystem’s deposit facility rate (DFR) or the euro short-term rate (€STR), also under a positive DFR. The measure is intended to remain in effect until 30 April 2023. This change will prevent an abrupt outflow of deposits into the market, at a time when some segments of the euro area repo markets are showing signs of collateral scarcity, and will allow for an in-depth assessment of how money markets are adjusting to the return to positive interest rates.
As it currently stands, the relevant legal framework provides that, if the DFR is negative, government deposits are remunerated up to the DFR or the €STR, whichever is lower. It also foresees a remuneration ceiling of 0% if the DFR is 0% or higher. However, market and liquidity conditions have changed since this ceiling was put in place and a temporary adjustment of the remuneration arrangements, in a context of normalisation of monetary policy, is warranted. The new temporary change to the remuneration does not alter the long-term desirability of encouraging market intermediation, and the ECB calls on relevant depositors to plan for alternative arrangements to central bank deposits.
Government deposits are non-monetary policy deposits accepted by the Eurosystem from any public entities of an EU Member State or any public entities of the European Union, except for publicly owned credit institutions, as laid down in Guideline ECB/2019/7

Compared with June:
consumer expectations for inflation over the next 12 months remained unchanged, while those for inflation three years ahead rose;
expected nominal spending growth over the next 12 months continued to outpace expected income growth;
expectations declined for economic growth over the next 12 months and rose for unemployment in 12 months’ time;
consumers expected the price of their home to grow slightly less over the next 12 months, while their expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift upwards.
Inflation. Perceived inflation over the previous 12 months continued to increase, with the median rate now standing at 7.9%, up from 7.2% in June. Inflation expectations remained well below the perceived past inflation rate, decreasing as the horizon extended into the future. The median expectation for inflation over the next 12 months remained unchanged at 5.0%, while that for three years ahead rose to 3.0%, up from 2.8% in June. Uncertainty about inflation 12 months ahead edged up in July, having remained stable since March 2022. Consumers’ inflation perceptions and expectations across income groups were closely aligned. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Consumers expected their income to grow by 0.8% over the next 12 months. This was a notch down from 0.9% in June, putting an end to the rebound from the trough of 0.5% in March 2022. The decline in expected income growth was concentrated among middle-income respondents, with higher-income respondents by contrast raising their expectations for income growth further. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the previous 12 months continued the acceleration that began in March 2021, reaching a new high of 5.4%. The largest increases came from middle-income respondents. Expectations for nominal spending growth over the next 12 months rose to 4.2%, up from 3.9% in June, owing to the significant increases anticipated by higher-income respondents. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations for the next 12 months declined from -1.3% in June to -1.9%, their lowest level since November 2020. This decline was broad-based across income and age groups. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate in the next 12 months rose to 12.0%, reaching their highest level since September 2021. However, survey data available at a quarterly frequency showed that in July unemployed respondents raised their expected probability of finding a job in the next three months to 27.3%, up from 23.8% in April. Employed respondents, in turn, slightly reduced their expected probability of losing their job in the next three months to 9.4%, down from 9.5% in April. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers again slightly lowered their expectations for the growth in price of their homes over the next 12 months to 3.2%. Expectations for mortgage interest rates 12 months ahead continued to drift up to 4.3% and now stand 1.0 percentage points higher than at the beginning of 2022. Both consumers’ perceived access to credit over the previous 12 months and their expectations over the next 12 months tightened again. Perceived and expected credit conditions are now at their tightest level since the start of the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) in April 2020. The share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is collected quarterly, further declined to 12.2% in July, down from 12.7% in April 2022.

The Europa Open Air concert will take place again on Thursday, 25 August, after a three-year break. Held on the banks of the Main river, it is one of the most renowned concerts in the Frankfurt area and is jointly organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Hessischer Rundfunk orchestra, Frankfurt Radio Symphony.
The theme of the event is “celebrating Europe”. The programme features popular classics by European composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Frédéric Chopin, Claude Debussy and Mieczysław Weinberg, performed by Frankfurt Radio Symphony. The evening will start with a performance from Hessischer Rundfunk’s big band.
“This event, at a time when there is once again a war on European soil, should serve as a reminder that we want to live in a society that is free and open, in which solidarity prevails over aggression. Europe is what unites us,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The concert will be broadcast live on German TV and radio and over the internet. Further information can be found on Hessischer Rundfunk’s website.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-March 2022, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The quarterly data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector and comprise a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-March 2022 data refer to 318 banking groups and 2457 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector’s balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the European Banking Authority’s implementing technical standards on supervisory reporting, while some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-March 2022 data.

About the survey
The Consumer Expectations Survey (CES) is a monthly online survey collecting timely information on the perceptions and expectations of consumers in the euro area, as well as their economic and financial behaviour. The topics covered in the CES range from inflation, consumption and income, housing market activity and house prices to labour market conditions, consumer finance, savings and investment, borrowing and credit access conditions, the general economic outlook and other central bank-related subjects. The information collected in the CES can, thus help complement other ECB surveys. The CES is currently based on around 14,000 interviewed consumers, aged 18 and above, from six euro area countries: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and the Netherlands. These countries represent 85% of euro area overall GDP and 83.8% of the total euro area population.
The survey helps us pursue our price stability mandate by improving the analytical basis for the ECB’s economic and monetary analysis. This in turn improves our understanding of financial vulnerabilities in the household sector and challenges to financial stability.
Starting in August 2022, the results of the CES are published on a monthly basis on the ECB’s website here: CES webpage.
CES latest results – June 2022
Compared to May, consumers now expect that in 12 months’ time:
Inflation will be higher;
Income growth will remain unchanged while nominal spending will rise considerably more than income;
Economic growth will be more negative and unemployment will rise;
House price growth will be slightly lower and mortgage interest rates will continue drifting up.
Inflation. Consumers’ perceived inflation over the past 12 months increased markedly, as did their expectations for future inflation. The median perceived inflation rate over the past 12 months rose to 7.2% from 6.6% in May, while the median expectation for inflation 12 months ahead only edged up to 5.0%. Inflation expectations three years ahead also increased noticeably to 2.8%, from 2.5% in May. Consumers’ uncertainty about inflation has stabilised since March after rising over the preceding months. (Link to Inflation results and charts)
Income and consumption. Expectations for nominal income growth 12 months ahead were unchanged at 0.9%. They remain higher for consumers aged 18-34 (at 1.8%) and for those with very low incomes. Perceptions of nominal spending growth over the past 12 months kept rising since April 2021, reaching 5.0%. Consumers with below-median incomes continued to perceive the highest nominal spending growth. Concerning future nominal spending growth, respondents’ expectations 12 months ahead edged up to 3.9%. (Link to Income and consumption results and charts)
Labour market and economic growth. Economic growth expectations 12 months ahead were slightly more negative than in May at -1.3% and broad-based across income and age groups. Consumers’ expectations turned negative in March 2022, dropping to a low of -1.8%, but the expected decline has moderated since then. Consistent with the lower expectations for economic growth, expectations for the unemployment rate 12 months ahead increased to 11.5%, close to the levels recorded at the beginning of the year. In April 2022, quarterly data show that respondents who are unemployed had cut their expectations of finding a job over the next three months from 26.7% in January to 23.8%. The expected probability of job loss over the next three months also fell to 9.5% from 10.3% in January. (Link to Labour market and growth results and charts)
Housing and credit access. Consumers’ expectations about the price growth of their home 12 months ahead declined marginally to 3.3%. Following some upward momentum in 2021, expectations have been levelling off since October of that year. Expectations for interest rates on mortgages in the next 12 months continued to drift up to 4.0% from their January low of 3.3%. Consumers’ perceived credit access conditions over the past 12 months tightened marginally and expectations 12 months ahead remained broadly unchanged. The share of consumers who report having applied for credit during the past three months, which is surveyed on a quarterly basis, declined further from 13.7% in January to 12.7% in April 2022.

Tighter credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties, relatively contained despite the war in Ukraine
Higher demand for funding secured against government bonds but lower demand for funding secured against equities
Clients’ liquidity needs resulting from variation margin requirements on their volatile commodity derivative portfolios largely met using credit lines
Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened over the March-May 2022 review period. This tightening seems relatively contained compared with previous surveys at a time of crisis. Price and non-price terms tightened for all counterparties except hedge funds, for which non-price terms remained, on balance, unchanged. The tightening continued the trend reported for the previous four quarters and was in line with the expectations expressed in the previous survey. The June 2022 survey respondents expected price and non-price terms to tighten further for almost all types of counterparty over the period from June 2022 to August 2022.
Turning to securities financing transactions, survey responses gave a mixed picture regarding financing conditions. This was reflected in the net percentages of participants reporting a slightly lower maximum amount and a slightly higher maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in increasing rates/spreads for funding secured against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had either increased or remained unchanged for most types of collateral. Responses also gave a mixed picture regarding demand for funding, with a significant share of respondents reporting higher demand for funding secured against government bonds but lower demand for funding secured against equities.
In the case of non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that, over the March-May 2022 review period, initial margin requirements had increased for all OTC derivative types and liquidity and trading had deteriorated for most OTC derivative types. Valuation disputes had increased in volume, duration and persistence for almost all OTC derivative types over the review period, but most noticeably for credit derivatives referencing corporates and for commodity derivatives.
In view of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting volatile commodity derivative markets, special questions were included in the June 2022 survey to assess the impact of margin requirements on survey respondents’ clients as well as on survey respondents’ respective institutions. A small number of responding institutions’ clients were experiencing liquidity strains resulting from variation margin requirements on their commodity derivative portfolios, which were largely met using credit lines. Survey respondents did not report any general market shifts related to the volatile commodity derivative markets. However, more than half of respondents reported shifts from exchange-traded commodity derivatives to less collateralised market segments (e.g. non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives). Only a small number reported a shift between exchanges or products.
The June 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank’s website, together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The June 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between March 2022 and May 2022. The results are based on the responses received from a panel of 25 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 11 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Climate risk shocks could spread throughout the financial system, notably in the event of a disorderly green transition
Financial market losses from abruptly repricing climate risks could affect investment funds and insurers as well as trigger corporate defaults and credit losses for banks
Macroprudential and microprudential policies should work in tandem to mitigate systemic risk
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report on how climate shocks can affect the European financial system. The findings show that climate risks can quickly spread and harm companies and banks alike. The report adds further evidence on the systemic nature of climate risks and provides a foundation for a macroprudential policy response.
The report identifies several amplifiers of climate risk across the financial system. Transition risks may be magnified because of economic and financial linkages between and across banks and companies. For example, a surge in carbon prices could increase the likelihood that the default of one company leads to the default of another. While this particularly applies to high-carbon companies, it could also affect their less carbon-intensive counterparties.
Meanwhile, interdependent natural hazards – such as water stress, heat stress and wildfires – can amplify physical climate risk, as they can cluster together and exacerbate each other. Market dynamics can also magnify the financial impact of physical risks. For example, a climate shock could lead to a sudden reassessment of climate risk pricing, thereby causing fire sales, where financial institutions – especially those with overlapping portfolios – quickly sell a large number of exposed assets at the same time at distressed prices.
Scenario analysis suggests that climate risks might take shape in the financial system in a specific order. First, unforeseen climate shocks could have an abrupt impact on market prices, initially hitting the portfolios of investment funds, pension funds and insurance companies. Second, this sudden repricing could cause companies to default, resulting in losses for exposed banks. In a disorderly transition scenario, marked by an immediate and substantial increase in carbon prices, respective market losses of insurers and investment funds could potentially amount to 3% and 25% on stress-tested assets in the near term. An orderly transition towards net zero by 2050 could soften such shocks and alleviate the fallout for companies and banks, reducing the probability of corporate defaults by around 13-20% in 2050 compared with today’s policies. It would also lessen credit losses for banks.
The report assesses the scope for macroprudential policies as part of a broader policy response to address the financial impact of climate change. It presents the case for adapting existing instruments, notably systemic risk buffers or concentration thresholds. Such measures could complement efforts at the microprudential level, such as the ECB’s supervisory climate agenda including the ongoing thematic review of climate risks and the 2022 climate risk stress test.
The report builds on two previous ECB/ESRB reports on climate risk.

HICP inflation expectations revised up across all horizons
Real GDP growth expectations revised down for the nearer term, but otherwise broadly stable
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2022, respondents revised up their inflation expectations for all horizons. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, these stand at 7.3%, 3.6% and 2.1% respectively, 1.3, 1.2 and 0.2 percentage points higher compared with the previous survey round. According to respondents, the upward revisions mainly reflect higher energy and food prices, but also the stronger than expected pass-through of input cost increases. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2027) stood at 2.2% on average, revised up by another 0.1 percentage point.
Real GDP growth expectations were revised down from the second quarter of 2022 onwards, as well as for 2023, but remained the same for 2024. Longer-term growth expectations were revised up marginally. Respondents noted that the stronger than expected outturn in the first quarter of 2022 largely offset the weaker dynamics expected for the other quarters. They report that the main factors contributing to this bleaker growth outlook include intensifying energy price pressures, the tightening of monetary policy around the world and the effect of inflation on the purchasing power of households. They noted that although the supply chain bottlenecks linked to the COVID-19 crisis have eased somewhat, they are still acting as a drag on the global economy. By contrast, fiscal measures against rising energy prices have cushioned the energy price shock to some extent, and the effects of the reopening of the economy have also played out positively.
Notwithstanding the downward revisions to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were again revised down for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.7% in 2022 to 6.4% by 2027. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level in the history of the ECB SPF, which started in 1999."

The Governing Council today approved the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI). The Governing Council assessed that the establishment of the TPI is necessary to support the effective transmission of monetary policy. In particular, as the Governing Council continues normalising monetary policy, the TPI will ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The singleness of the Governing Council’s monetary policy is a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate.
The TPI will be an addition to our toolkit and can be activated to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. By safeguarding the transmission mechanism, the TPI will allow the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate.
Subject to fulfilling established criteria, the Eurosystem will be able to make secondary market purchases of securities issued in jurisdictions experiencing a deterioration in financing conditions not warranted by country-specific fundamentals, to counter risks to the transmission mechanism to the extent necessary. The scale of TPI purchases would depend on the severity of the risks facing monetary policy transmission. Purchases are not restricted ex ante.
Purchase parameters
TPI purchases would be focused on public sector securities (marketable debt securities issued by central and regional governments as well as agencies, as defined by the ECB) with a remaining maturity of between one and ten years. Purchases of private sector securities could be considered, if appropriate.
Eligibility
The Governing Council will consider a cumulative list of criteria to assess whether the jurisdictions in which the Eurosystem may conduct purchases under the TPI pursue sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. These criteria will be an input into the Governing Council’s decision-making and will be dynamically adjusted to the unfolding risks and conditions to be addressed.
In particular, the criteria include: (1) compliance with the EU fiscal framework: not being subject to an excessive deficit procedure (EDP), or not being assessed as having failed to take effective action in response to an EU Council recommendation under Article 126(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU); (2) absence of severe macroeconomic imbalances: not being subject to an excessive imbalance procedure (EIP) or not being assessed as having failed to take the recommended corrective action related to an EU Council recommendation under Article 121(4) TFEU; (3) fiscal sustainability: in ascertaining that the trajectory of public debt is sustainable, the Governing Council will take into account, where available, the debt sustainability analyses by the European Commission, the European Stability Mechanism, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions, together with the ECB’s internal analysis; (4) sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies: complying with the commitments submitted in the recovery and resilience plans for the Recovery and Resilience Facility and with the European Commission’s country-specific recommendations in the fiscal sphere under the European Semester.
Activation
A decision by the Governing Council to activate the TPI will be based on a comprehensive assessment of market and transmission indicators, an evaluation of the eligibility criteria and a judgement that the activation of purchases under the TPI is proportionate to the achievement of the ECB’s primary objective.
Purchases would be terminated either upon a durable improvement in transmission, or based on an assessment that persistent tensions are due to country fundamentals.
Creditor treatment
The Eurosystem accepts the same (pari passu) treatment as private or other creditors with respect to bonds issued by euro area governments and purchased by the Eurosystem under the TPI, in accordance with the terms of such bonds.
Relation to the monetary policy stance
In order to avoid potential interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance, should the TPI be activated, the Governing Council will address the implications of the TPI purchases for the scale of the aggregate Eurosystem monetary policy debt security portfolio and the amount of excess liquidity. Purchases under the TPI would be conducted such that they cause no persistent impact on the overall Eurosystem balance sheet and hence on the monetary policy stance.
PEPP reinvestment flexibility
PEPP reinvestment flexibility will continue to be the first line of defence to counter risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic.
Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT)
The OMT is part of the Eurosystem’s toolkit. The Governing Council retains discretion to conduct the OMT for countries that fulfil the requisite criteria for the OMT.

Credit standards tightened for firms and households, with uncertainty remaining high and monetary policy becoming less accommodative
Firms’ demand for loans continued to increase, driven by working capital needs
Banks report deterioration in access to wholesale funding
According to the July 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened considerably further (net percentage of banks standing at 16%, see Chart 1) in the second quarter of 2022. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a strong net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 24%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households tightened moderately (net percentage of 9%). In the context of high uncertainty, continuing supply chain disruptions and high energy and input prices, banks cite perceptions of increased risk and lower risk tolerance as factors behind the net tightening of credit standards for firms. As monetary policy is becoming less accommodative, euro area banks also reported that their cost of funds and balance sheet constraints had contributed to the tightening of credit standards for loans to firms and households. For the third quarter of 2022, they expect a net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms of a similar magnitude to that in the second quarter (18%). In addition, euro area banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for both housing loans (24%) and consumer credit (13%).
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened for loans to firms and loans to households in the second quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, this was due mainly to a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans, while margins on average loans widened more moderately. Despite the net tightening of terms and conditions, margins on both loans for house purchase and consumer credit narrowed, partly reflecting the fact that market reference rates relevant for banks’ funding costs increased more than the interest rates on loans to households.
Banks reported, on balance, an increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the second quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand continued to be driven by firms’ financing needs for working capital, which is likely related to the higher prices for energy and raw materials in the context of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Fixed investment had a dampening impact on firms’ net demand for loans, indicating that they may be postponing investment in the current uncertain environment. In addition, the positive contribution of the general level of interest rates to loan demand was more moderate compared with the previous quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, net demand for housing loans fell after increasing in the first quarter, while demand for consumer credit and other lending to households continued to rise in net terms. The net decrease in demand for housing loans was due mainly to lower consumer confidence and the general level of interest rates, while the increase in demand for consumer credit was driven predominantly by spending on durables. For the third quarter of 2022, banks expect a net decrease in firms’ demand for loans, a strong net decrease in demand for housing loans and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to money markets, securitisation and particularly debt securities deteriorated, in net terms, in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the tightening of financial market conditions for banks. By contrast, access to retail funding improved slightly over the same period. In the first half of 2022, euro area banks’ non-performing loan ratios had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises, but there was no reported impact on loans for house purchase and consumer credit or other lending. Across most of the main economic sectors, euro area banks indicated a more pronounced net tightening of credit standards for new loans to enterprises. They also reported a net increase in demand for loans or credit lines across all main economic sectors, in line with the reported overall increase in firms’ demand for loans in the first and second quarters of 2022.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the July 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the third quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The July 2022 survey round was conducted between 10 and 28 June 2022. A total of 153 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Conversion rate of kuna fixed at 7.53450 = EUR 1
Croatian banks already supervised by ECB since 2020
Today the Council of the European Union formally approved the accession of Croatia to the euro area on 1 January 2023 and determined a Croatian kuna conversion rate of 7.53450 per euro – this coincides with the level of the current central rate of the kuna in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II). The European Central Bank (ECB) and Hrvatska narodna banka agreed to monitor developments in the Croatian kuna against the euro on the foreign exchange market until 1 January 2023.
With the entry into force of the close cooperation framework between the ECB and Hrvatska narodna banka on 1 October 2020, the ECB became responsible for directly supervising eight significant institutions and overseeing 15 less significant institutions in Croatia.

Notes
The agreement to monitor the kuna is in the context of ERM II. Participation in ERM II and observance of the normal fluctuation margins for at least the last two years is one of the convergence criteria to be fulfilled ahead of euro area accession.
The conversion rate of the kuna is set by way of an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 2866/98, which will become effective on 1 January 2023."

ECB to account for climate change in its corporate bond purchases, collateral framework, disclosure requirements and risk management, in line with its climate action plan
Measures aim to reduce financial risk related to climate change on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, encourage transparency, and support the green transition of the economy
Measures to be regularly reviewed to check that they are fit for purpose and aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate neutrality objectives
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to take further steps to include climate change considerations in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy framework. It decided to adjust corporate bond holdings in the Eurosystem’s monetary policy portfolios and its collateral framework, to introduce climate-related disclosure requirements and to enhance its risk management practices.
These measures are designed in full accordance with the Eurosystem’s primary objective of maintaining price stability. They aim to better take into account climate-related financial risk in the Eurosystem balance sheet and, with reference to our secondary objective, support the green transition of the economy in line with the EU’s climate neutrality objectives. Moreover, our measures provide incentives to companies and financial institutions to be more transparent about their carbon emissions and to reduce them.
“With these decisions we are turning our commitment to fighting climate change into real action”, says ECB President Christine Lagarde. “Within our mandate, we are taking further concrete steps to incorporate climate change into our monetary policy operations. And, as part of our evolving climate agenda, there will be more steps to align our activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement.”
The following concrete measures have been decided:
Corporate bond holdings: The Eurosystem aims to gradually decarbonise its corporate bond holdings, on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. To that end, the Eurosystem will tilt these holdings towards issuers with better climate performance through the reinvestment of the sizeable redemptions expected over the coming years. Better climate performance will be measured with reference to lower greenhouse gas emissions, more ambitious carbon reduction targets and better climate-related disclosures.
Tilting means that the share of assets on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet issued by companies with a better climate performance will be increased compared to that by companies with a poorer climate performance. This aims to mitigate climate-related financial risks on the Eurosystem balance sheet. It also provides incentives to issuers to improve their disclosures and reduce their carbon emissions in the future.
The ECB expects the measures to apply from October 2022, and further details will follow shortly before then. The ECB will start publishing climate-related information on corporate bond holdings regularly as of the first quarter of 2023.
In any case, the volume of corporate bond purchases will continue to be determined solely by monetary policy considerations and their role in achieving the ECB’s inflation target.
Collateral framework: The Eurosystem will limit the share of assets issued by entities with a high carbon footprint that can be pledged as collateral by individual counterparties when borrowing from the Eurosystem. The new limits regime aims to reduce climate-related financial risks in Eurosystem credit operations. At first, the Eurosystem will apply such limits only to marketable debt instruments issued by companies outside the financial sector (non-financial corporations). Additional asset classes may also fall under the new limits regime as the quality of climate-related data improves. The measure is expected to apply before the end of 2024 provided that the necessary technical preconditions are in place. To encourage banks and other counterparties to prepare early, the Eurosystem will run tests of the limits regime ahead of its actual implementation. Further details, including the timeline, will be communicated in due course.
Additionally, the Eurosystem will, as of this year, consider climate change risks when reviewing haircuts applied to corporate bonds used as collateral. Haircuts are reductions applied to the value of collateral based on its riskiness.
In any case, all measures will ensure that ample collateral remains available, allowing monetary policy to continue to be implemented effectively.
Climate-related disclosure requirements for collateral: The Eurosystem will only accept marketable assets and credit claims from companies and debtors that comply with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations (once the directive is fully implemented). As the implementation of the CSRD has been delayed, the new eligibility criteria are expected to apply as of 2026.
This requirement will apply to all companies within the scope of the CSRD. It will help improve disclosures and generate better data for financial institutions, investors and civil society.
To encourage stakeholders to align with the new rules early on, the ECB will run test exercises one year ahead of actual implementation.
However, a significant proportion of the assets that can be pledged as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, such as asset-backed securities and covered bonds, do not fall under the CSRD. To ensure a proper assessment of climate-related financial risks for those assets as well, the Eurosystem supports better and harmonised disclosures of climate-related data for them and, acting as a catalyst, engages closely with the relevant authorities to make this happen.
Risk assessment and management: The Eurosystem will further enhance its risk assessment tools and capabilities to better include climate-related risks. For example, ECB analysis has shown that, despite the progress already achieved by the rating agencies, current disclosure standards are not yet satisfactory.
To improve the external assessment of climate-related risks, the Eurosystem will urge rating agencies to be more transparent about how they incorporate climate risks into their ratings and to be more ambitious in their disclosure requirements on climate risks. The Eurosystem is in close dialogue with the relevant authorities on this matter.
Additionally, the Eurosystem agreed on a set of common minimum standards for how national central banks’ in-house credit assessment systems should include climate-related risks in their ratings. These standards will enter into force by the end of 2024.
Looking ahead, the Governing Council is committed to regularly reviewing all the measures outlined above. It will assess their effects and adapt them, if necessary: (1) to confirm that they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives; (2) to ensure – within its mandate – that the relevant measures continue to support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU climate neutrality objectives; (3) to respond to future improvements in climate data and climate risk modelling or changes in regulation; and (4) to address additional environmental challenges, within its price stability mandate.
Companies and governments need to do their part to address climate risks by enhancing disclosures and following up on their commitments to reduce carbon emissions.
The decisions described above are part of the climate action plan announced in July 2021. The ECB’s work is progressing as outlined in the climate roadmap, and may have to be aligned if and when the timetable in EU legislation changes.
The ECB is also including climate change considerations in areas of its work besides monetary policy, including banking supervision, financial stability, economic analysis, statistical data and corporate sustainability. With this commitment, we aim to make a real difference in three ways: (1) by managing and mitigating the financial risk of climate change and assessing its economic impact, (2) by promoting sustainable finance to support an orderly transition towards a low-carbon economy and (3) by sharing our expertise to help foster wider changes in economic behaviour.
An overview of ongoing actions can be found in the ECB-wide climate agenda (see annex).

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-2021, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The annual data cover the information required to analyse the EU banking sector, comprising a broader set of data than the quarterly release. The end-December 2021 data refer to 317 banking groups and 2,477 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector balance sheet. These data include an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting of the European Banking Authority. However some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
As a consequence of the 2008 financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision strengthened its liquidity framework by developing, among other things, a minimum requirement for funding: the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). This ratio promotes a more resilient banking sector by encouraging banks to ensure funding resilience over the longer term, i.e. to fund long-term assets with long-term liabilities to reduce dependency on short-term refinancing.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed along with the end-December 2021 data.

Today the Governing Council met to exchange views on the current market situation. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions.
Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council.

Euro remains second most widely used currency globally after US dollar
Euro’s share at around 19% across various indicators of international currency use
Euro’s global appeal linked to stronger Economic and Monetary Union
The international role of the euro remained stable in 2021, with its share across various indicators of international currency use averaging around 19%. This was one of the main findings in the annual review of The international role of the euro published today by the European Central Bank (ECB).
“Following the pandemic, the euro area has experienced one of the steepest recoveries in its history, thanks also to ample fiscal and monetary policy support. Now we face rising global inflation driven by higher energy costs, supply bottlenecks and normalising demand as economies reopen. On balance, however, these developments have not resulted in a significant change in the international role of the euro,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves increased by 0.5 percentage points to 20.6% in 2021, and the share of the euro in international bond issuance rose by almost 3 percentage points to 24.6%. Outstanding international loans and outstanding international deposits also increased markedly. However, the share of the euro in foreign exchange settlements declined. The share of the euro in the outstanding stock of international debt securities, as well as in invoicing of extra-euro imports and exports, remained broadly stable.
Looking ahead, the international role of the euro will be primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union, including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete Economic and Monetary Union.
This year’s interim edition of the report includes five analytical boxes. Box 1 discusses the implications for the international roles of the euro and the US dollar of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the financial sanctions imposed on Russia. “The Union’s economic and financial resilience to the current geopolitical challenges can also support the international role of the euro,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
Box 2 reviews recent developments in the international role of the Chinese renminbi. Box 3 provides insights into the international use of the euro as a financing currency across different economic sectors and the trends over time. Box 4 examines the interplay between the exchange rate elasticities of euro area external trade and the role of the euro as an invoicing currency.
Finally, Box 5 examines the role of the euro in the global market for stablecoins.

High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The Governing Council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term.
In May inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, including due to the impact of the war. But inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. Eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. However, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. The new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 – higher than in the March projections. This means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the Governing Council’s target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024 – also above the March projections.
Russia’s unjustified aggression towards Ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in Europe and beyond. It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic. Once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected to pick up again. This outlook is broadly reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual real GDP growth at 2.8% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. Compared with the March projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up.
On the basis of its updated assessment, the Governing Council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy. Throughout this process, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.
Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.
As concerns the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Key ECB interest rates
The Governing Council undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to its forward guidance, should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied.
Accordingly, and in line with the Governing Council’s policy sequencing, the Governing Council intends to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its July monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, the Governing Council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Looking further ahead, the Governing Council expects to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. The calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the September meeting.
Beyond September, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with the Governing Council’s commitment to its 2% medium-term target, the pace at which the Governing Council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation to develop in the medium term.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III will end on 23 June 2022.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the ECB’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Number of offices continued to decline in most EU Member States, by 1.98% on average
Number of bank employees declined by 0.85% on average
Degree of banking sector concentration continues to differ widely across countries
The European Central Bank (ECB) has updated its dataset of structural financial indicators for the banking sector in the European Union (EU) for the end of 2021. This annual dataset comprises statistics on the number of offices and employees of EU credit institutions, data on the degree of concentration of the banking sector in each EU Member State and data on foreign-controlled institutions in EU national banking markets.
The structural financial indicators show a further decline in the number of bank offices in the EU, averaging 1.98% across Member States. Falls ranging from -0.2% to -22.93% were observed in 20 of the 27 countries. The total number of offices in the EU at the end of 2021 was 138,294, 82.56% of which were located in the euro area.
In the course of 2021, the number of employees of credit institutions fell in 21 EU Member States, with an average decline of 0.85% across all countries. This decline in the number of bank employees is a trend that has been observed in most countries since 2008.
The data also indicate that the degree of concentration in the banking sector (measured by the share of assets held by the five largest banks) continues to vary considerably between EU Member States. At the national level the share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions ranged from 29.65% to 98.01%, while the EU average at the end of 2021 was 67.71%.
The structural financial indicators are published by the ECB on an annual basis.

Biennial report assesses progress of seven non-euro area EU Member States
Positive assessment of Croatia in view of possible euro adoption on 1 January 2023
Progress has been limited overall owing to challenging economic conditions
Limited progress has been made by non-euro area EU countries on economic convergence with the euro area since 2020, the June 2022 Convergence Report of the European Central Bank (ECB) concludes. This is mainly due to challenging economic conditions.
The report, which is issued every two years, assesses progress towards euro adoption by seven EU countries that have not yet adopted the euro: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden.
The report includes a more in-depth assessment of Croatia, which has announced its intention to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023. Bulgaria and Croatia both joined the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and the banking union on 10 July 2020.
The coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis led to a significant drop in economic activity in 2020, from which all countries under review rebounded strongly. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has weighed on growth, and inflation has increased in all the countries assessed. However, it is too early to draw any firm conclusions about how the convergence paths will be affected. The forward-looking convergence assessment is surrounded by high uncertainty, and the full impact can only be evaluated ex post.
As regards the price stability criterion, only Croatia and Sweden recorded inflation rates below or well below the reference value of 4.9%. This reference rate is based on the average inflation figures recorded in the three best-performing countries over the last 12 months – Finland, France and Greece (after exclusion of the outliers: Malta and Portugal). In the five other countries assessed – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania – inflation rates were well above the reference value over the last 12 months, as was also the case in the 2020 Convergence Report.
On the fiscal criteria, at the time of the publication of the report, only Romania is subject to an excessive deficit procedure (launched in April 2020). Although three further countries under review – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Hungary – exceeded the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2021, no new excessive deficit procedures were opened.
After a sharp increase in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, budget deficits remained elevated in all countries in 2021 except Sweden. Compared with 2020, budget balances improved in all the countries under review in 2021 except Bulgaria and the Czech Republic. According to the European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline in most of the countries in 2022 and 2023. Nonetheless, it is expected to exceed the reference value in 2023 in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania.
The government debt-to-GDP ratio was between 20% and 40% in Bulgaria and Sweden in 2021 and reached between 40% and 60% in the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania, while the debt ratios in Croatia and Hungary were above the 60% reference value.
In 2022 and 2023 government debt ratios are expected to decline in four of the countries as a result of both the improvement in economic activity and the phasing-out of fiscal measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, while budget balances are expected to be burdened by new measures taken in response to high energy prices and the Russia-Ukraine war.
As regards the exchange rate criterion, the Bulgarian lev and the Croatian kuna participated in ERM II for most of the two-year reference period from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022, at central rates of 1.95583 levs per euro and 7.53450 kuna per euro respectively. The exchange rate of the Croatian kuna displayed a low degree of volatility and traded close to its central rate. The Bulgarian lev did not deviate from its central rate. Except for the Romanian leu, the exchange rates of the currencies not participating in ERM II showed a relatively high degree of volatility.
When considering the convergence of long-term interest rates, the lowest 12-month average long-term interest rates were recorded in Bulgaria, Croatia and Sweden. At 2.5%, the Czech Republic was just below the reference value of 2.6%. Two of the countries under review – Hungary and Poland – recorded 12-month average long-term interest rates above the reference value, while in Romania the 12-month average long-term interest rate was well above the reference value.
The strength of the institutional environment is an important factor in the sustainability of convergence over time. Except in Sweden, the quality of institutions and governance in the countries under review is relatively weak. When it comes to legal convergence, Croatia is the only country examined where the legal framework is fully compatible with the requirements for adoption of the euro under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (Statute of the ESCB).
Croatia
The ECB’s assessment concludes that Croatia is within the reference values of the convergence criteria.
Price stability
In April 2022 the 12-month average rate of HICP inflation in Croatia was 4.7%, i.e. below the reference value of 4.9%. This rate is expected to increase gradually over the coming months, driven mainly by the higher commodity prices, broadening price pressures and further aggravation of supply bottlenecks as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war.
Looking ahead, there are concerns about whether inflation convergence is sustainable over the longer term in Croatia. In order to prevent the build-up of excessive price pressures and macroeconomic imbalances, the convergence process must be supported by appropriate policies.
General government deficit and debt ratios
Croatia’s general government budget balance was just below the 3% of GDP deficit reference value in 2021, while its debt ratio was above the 60% of GDP reference value, but declined from the previous year. The deficit ratio amounted to 2.9% of GDP in 2021, which fulfills the deficit criterion. The debt ratio was 79.8% of GDP in 2021, a decline from the peak of 87.3% of GDP in 2020. This strong decline in the debt ratio ensured fulfillment of the debt criterion.
The European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast indicates that Croatia is on track to continue to be compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, the European Commission found in its 2022 European Semester Spring Package that Croatia faces medium debt sustainability risks over the medium term. To safeguard sound public finances and put the debt ratio onto a long-lasting downward path, it is essential that Croatia implements the envisaged fiscal reforms under its recovery and resilience plan.
Exchange rate
The Croatian kuna was included in ERM II on 10 July 2020 at a central rate of 7.53450 kuna per euro with a standard fluctuation band of ±15%. Over the two-year reference period from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022, the exchange rate displayed a low degree of volatility and the kuna traded close to its central rate.
Long-term interest rates
Over the reference period from May 2021 to April 2022, long-term interest rates in Croatia stood at 0.8% on average, which was below the 2.6% reference value for the interest rate convergence criterion. Long-term interest rates in Croatia have decreased since 2012, with 12-month average rates declining from slightly below 7% to below 1%.
Sustainable convergence
Croatia would benefit from stability-oriented economic policies and wide-ranging structural reforms. In 2022 the European Commission concluded that the macroeconomic imbalances that the country was experiencing continued to subside in 2021, returning to their favourable pre-pandemic trends. Structural reforms would help Croatia improve its institutional and business environment, boost competition and make its public administration and its judicial system more efficient. In October 2020 the ECB became responsible for directly supervising eight significant institutions and overseeing 15 less significant institutions in Croatia.
Legal criteria
Croatian law is compatible with the Treaties and the Statute of the ESCB as required under Article 131 of the Treaty.

Notes
European Commission’s Convergence Report 2022
The Convergence Report of the ECB reviews the economic and legal convergence of non-euro area EU Member States with a derogation every second year or at the request of a specific country. It assesses the degree of sustainable economic convergence with the euro area, whether the national legislation is compatible with the EU legal framework, and whether the statutory requirements are fulfilled for the respective national central banks. Given its “opt-out” clause, Denmark is not covered by the assessment unless this is requested by the country.
The cut-off date for the statistics included in this Convergence Report was 25 May 2022. The reference period for the price stability and long-term interest rate criteria is from May 2021 to April 2022. For exchange rates, the reference period is from 26 May 2020 to 25 May 2022. Historical data on fiscal positions cover the period up to 2021. Forecasts are based on the European Commission’s Spring 2022 Economic Forecast and the most recent convergence programmes of the countries concerned, as well as other information relevant to a forward-looking examination of the sustainability of convergence.
Since November 2014 any country joining the euro area has also joined the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and the other components of the banking union. The banking system of the country in question is subject to a comprehensive assessment conducted by the ECB. On 10 July 2020 the ECB decided to establish close cooperation with Българска народна банка (Bulgarian National Bank) and Hrvatska narodna banka following the fulfilment of the necessary supervisory and legislative prerequisites. On 1 October 2020 the ECB became the supervisor in charge of common procedures for all supervised entities and assumed responsibility for the oversight of less significant institutions in the two countries."

Euro area enterprises continued to signal a recovery in business activity, but firms’ profitability was reduced by surging input costs
The availability of external funds continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace, as euro area firms deemed the macroeconomic environment to have adversely affected the availability of funds.
While the availability of external funds was broadly in line with firms’ demand for financing, enterprises reported a tightening of financing conditions and expect a deterioration in the availability of funds
The results of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area for the period from October 2021 to March 2022 indicate that the recovery in firms’ economic activity continued, with increases in turnover reported more frequently among large enterprises than among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Chart 1). However, firms’ profitability was reduced by surging production costs, with 89% of firms reporting, in net terms,

an increase in raw materials and energy costs and 66% in labour costs, both standing at a historical peak in the survey. The impact of supply disruptions and higher energy costs, which are likely to be related in part to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, is expected to continue to affect prices (Chart 2). Moreover, the perceived importance of expected inflation as a factor in selling prices has increased compared with 2020, with 58% of firms now reporting expected inflation as a “very important” factor (up from 30% in 2020).
In this survey round, while euro area firms felt that changes in the general economic outlook had had a strong negative impact on their access to finance (-29%, down from 8%), with a similar negative impact among SMEs and large firms, the availability of external funds still continued to improve, albeit at a slower pace. Overall, smaller improvements in firms’ access to external funds broadly compensated for the moderate increases in their financing needs, so that the external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the supply of external financing – reached 1% (up from -4% in the previous round).
A significant number of euro area firms reported a tightening of financing conditions, with 34% signalling increases in bank interest rates, up from 5% in the previous round (Chart 3). A comparable percentage has not been observed in the SAFE since 2012 and is consistent with the recent net widening on margins applied to bank loans also reported by banks in the April 2022 bank lending survey. Looking ahead firms anticipated a deterioration in access to bank loans and credit lines for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, probably reflecting the prevailing uncertainty and a changing attitude on the part of banks.
This report presents the main results of the 26th round of the SAFE in the euro area, which was conducted between 7 March 2022 and 15 April 2022, and covered the period from October 2021 to March 2022. The sample comprised 10,950 firms, of which 9,999 (91.3%) are SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Impact of war on energy prices, inflation and growth amplifies existing vulnerabilities
Market reaction to invasion largely orderly, but risk of further correction remains
Banks face weaker profitability after strong recovery in 2021
Financial stability conditions in the euro area have worsened as the Russian invasion of Ukraine leads to higher energy and commodity prices and increases risks to euro area inflation and growth, the May 2022 Financial Stability Review (FSR) published today by the European Central Bank (ECB) concludes.
“The terrible war in Ukraine has brought immense human suffering,” ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos said. “It has also increased financial stability risks through its impact on virtually all aspects of economic activity and financing conditions.”
The market reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been largely orderly. However, prices for commodities and energy have remained elevated and volatile, which has caused some stress in derivatives markets for these products. Despite recent adjustments, some assets remain at risk of further corrections should the growth outlook weaken further and/or inflation turn out to be significantly higher than expected.
Vulnerabilities may increase due to the uncertain path of the Russia-Ukraine war and shifting expectations of policy normalisation in advanced economies. Other potential global developments, such as a broader resurgence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, weaknesses in key emerging market economies or a sharper slowdown in Chinese economic activity, could also affect risks to growth and inflation.
Euro area non-financial corporations face challenges from rising input prices and a more clouded economic outlook. This may increase corporate defaults, especially for firms and sectors that have not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. Moreover, highly indebted firms and those with lower credit ratings may struggle with tighter financing conditions.
Euro area house prices have continued rising and mortgage lending growth has been accelerating, although a widespread extension of fixed-rate mortgages should shield many borrowers from higher interest rates in the near term.
The profitability prospects for European banks have weakened again, following a strong recovery in 2021. The potential impact of increased energy prices, higher inflation and weaker growth could cause asset quality risks to materialise. At the same time, only a few banks have significant direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and a recent vulnerability analysis carried out by the ECB indicates that the euro area banking system should remain resilient even under severely adverse economic scenarios.
Significant flows have taken place from investment funds that manage corporate bond portfolios to funds that manage sovereign bond exposures, as well as from growth to value equity funds. So far, these shifts have not been systemically disruptive, but the sector remains vulnerable due to its low liquidity, high duration risk and high exposure to bonds issued by weak corporates. Some funds also face additional risks from excessive leverage in derivatives or from investments in crypto-assets.
The resilience of the financial system would benefit from a more effective capital buffer framework. As recently proposed by the ECB, higher buffers that can be released in periods of stress would improve the ability of banks to absorb losses and maintain lending. Regulation to address risks in the non-bank financial sector, stemming for example from liquidity mismatches, leverage or margining practices, also needs to be strengthened.

Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly from December 2021 to February 2022, mostly ahead of Russia-Ukraine conflict
Market participants reported mixed results for financing conditions in securities financing markets, along with slightly deteriorating credit conditions and liquidity in OTC derivatives markets
Longer term, market participants reported tighter overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions
The responses contained in the March 2022 summary mainly cover the period preceding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, they only reflect the impact of this geopolitical development to a limited degree.
Overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly over the period from December 2021 to February 2022. While price terms became tighter across the board, non-price terms were more restrictive for non-financial corporations only. This tightening continues the trend reported in the previous three quarters and is broadly in line with expectations expressed in the previous survey. Looking ahead, respondents to the March survey expected a further tightening of price and non-price terms for all types of counterparty over the period from March to May 2022.
Turning to securities financing transactions, survey responses for financing conditions were mixed. This was reflected in net percentages of participants reporting a slightly higher maximum amount and maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in slightly increasing rates/spreads for funding against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had increased slightly or were unchanged for all types of collateral. Respondents reported stronger demand for funding against government bonds, but weaker demand for funding against most other collateral types.
As for non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that initial margin requirements had increased slightly for many types of OTC derivative, and that liquidity and trading had deteriorated for many OTC derivative types over the December 2021 to February 2022 review period.
Specific questions included in the March 2022 survey looked into the longer-term trend by asking respondents to compare credit terms and conditions observed in early March 2022 with those reported in the previous year (i.e. in early March 2021). Compared with the previous year, overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had tightened across all counterparties. In net terms, credit standards for secured funding had also tightened. Survey respondents reported that non-price conditions in OTC derivatives markets were unchanged for all types of derivative relative to the previous year.
The March 2022 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the ECB’s website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The March 2022 survey collected qualitative information on changes between December 2021 and February 2022. The results are based on responses from a panel of 27 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 13 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Governor invited to discuss the impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine
ECB to offer traineeships to Ukrainian citizens
Today, the Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Kyrylo Shevchenko, joined an ad hoc meeting of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) General Council.
[

]
During the meeting participants discussed the economic impact of the war on Ukraine. General Council members expressed their full support for the people of Ukraine: “Today’s meeting is a strong sign of European unity in the face of the war against Ukraine”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
National Central Banks of the ESCB decided to offer traineeship opportunities for Ukrainian citizens. For its part, the ECB will support young Ukrainians in acquiring professional experience in a European institution by providing 15 traineeships to cover its organisational needs.
The ECB is looking for recent graduates and young professionals to join the ECB for maximum of 12 months. Traineeships provide an opportunity to both put into practice knowledge acquired while studying and gain a better understanding of what working for Europe entails. The relevant vacancy notice will be published on the ECB’s website in the coming weeks, and the selection process will follow the ECB’s usual recruitment procedure. Successful applicants will join business areas based on their profiles and the ECB’s business needs.
An overview of the ECB’s actions in response to the war is available on our website.

Size of repo line remains unchanged at €4.5 billion
ECB has extended several liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks until 15 January 2023
Extensions address increased uncertainty and regional spillover risks owing to war in Ukraine
The European Central Bank (ECB) and Banca Naţională a României (BNR) have agreed to renew the repo line arrangement to provide euro liquidity to the BNR. The arrangement will now expire on 15 January 2023. A previous repo line that had been established in 2020 expired on 31 March 2022.
Under the repo line arrangement, the ECB provides up to €4.5 billion of euro liquidity to the BNR in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.
The continuation of the repo line with the BNR follows the ECB’s decision in March 2022 to extend the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and several bilateral liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks until 15 January 2023. In the context of heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the liquidity lines aim to prevent spillback effects on euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy.

Forecasters cite war in Ukraine as main factor behind macroeconomic forecast revisions
HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2022 and 2023 but unchanged for 2024 at 1.9%
Longer term inflation expectations revised up from 2.0% to 2.1%
Real GDP growth expectations on balance revised down
Unemployment rate expectations revised down again for all horizons
In the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2022, respondents revised their inflation expectations for 2022 and 2023 upward, to 6.0% and 2.4% respectively. Expectations for 2024 were unrevised at 1.9%. Regarding the near-term outlook, respondents viewed high inflation as being primarily determined by “cost-push” rather than “demand-pull” factors, and considered that the conflict in Ukraine had re-ignited and amplified price pressures that had started to show signs of peaking. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 2.1%, revised up from 2.0% in the previous survey.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents’ expectations were revised down for 2022 and 2023 and slightly up for 2024, but remained for all years above longer-term growth expectations which edged down marginally to 1.4%. The profile of expected quarter-on-quarter growth in 2022 was revised down in particular for the second quarter (from 1.0% to 0.5%) but while about 25% of respondents who provided a forecast quarterly growth profile saw at least one quarter of negative growth in 2022, only 4% forecasted a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth).
Notwithstanding the downward revision to expected GDP growth, unemployment rate expectations were revised down further, by between 0.1 and 0.3 percentage points for all horizons. Respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 6.9% in 2022 to 6.6% by 2026. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level for 15 years."

Russia’s aggression in Ukraine is causing enormous suffering. It is also affecting the economy, in Europe and beyond. The conflict and the associated uncertainty are weighing heavily on the confidence of businesses and consumers. Trade disruptions are leading to new shortages of materials and inputs. Surging energy and commodity prices are reducing demand and holding back production. How the economy develops will crucially depend on how the conflict evolves, on the impact of current sanctions and on possible further measures. At the same time, economic activity is still being supported by the reopening of the economy after the crisis phase of the pandemic. Inflation has increased significantly and will remain high over the coming months, mainly because of the sharp rise in energy costs. Inflation pressures have intensified across many sectors.
At today’s meeting the Governing Council judged that the incoming data since its last meeting reinforce its expectation that net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme should be concluded in the third quarter. Looking ahead, the ECB’s monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook. In the current conditions of high uncertainty, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to contribute to safeguarding financial stability.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. At today’s meeting the Governing Council judged that the incoming data since its last meeting reinforce its expectation that net asset purchases under the APP should be concluded in the third quarter. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect the Governing Council’s evolving assessment of the outlook.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of the Governing Council’s net purchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue to be determined by the Governing Council’s forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards tightened for firms owing to perceptions of increased risk, with further tightening expected
Loan demand from firms continued to increase, driven mainly by working capital needs
ECB’s monetary policy seen to continue to support lending, but less so than in previous survey rounds
According to the April 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened (net percentage of banks standing at 6%, see Chart 1) in the first quarter of 2022. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a slight net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 2%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households continued to ease (net percentage of -5%). Banks referred to perceptions of increased risk and decreased risk tolerance, in the context of high uncertainty, supply chain disruptions and high energy and input prices, as factors behind the net tightening of credit standards for firms. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a considerably stronger net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms, likely reflecting the uncertain economic impact of the war in Ukraine and the anticipation of less accommodative monetary policy. In addition, banks expect a moderate net tightening of credit standards for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened moderately for loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase in the first quarter of 2022. For loans to firms, this was mainly due to a considerable widening of margins on riskier loans, while margins on average loans widened less. For consumer credit and other lending to households, overall terms and conditions eased slightly on account of narrower loan margins.
Banks reported, on balance, a continued increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the first quarter of 2022 (see Chart 2). Loan demand was driven by a strong positive impact of financing needs of firms for working capital, reflecting supply chain disruptions as well as precautionary inventories and liquidity holdings. Fixed investment continued to have a positive impact on loan demand, but less than in the previous quarter. In addition, the low general level of interest rates as well as other financing needs, including mergers and acquisitions activity and debt refinancing and restructuring, contributed positively to loan demand from firms. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households increased further in net terms in the first quarter of 2022. The net increase in housing loan demand was mainly driven by the general level of interest rates. Demand for consumer credit was supported by spending on durable consumption goods and – to a lesser extent – by consumer confidence. For the second quarter of 2022, banks expect a continued net increase in firms’ loan demand, but a net decrease in the demand for housing loans and broadly unchanged demand for consumer credit.
According to the banks surveyed, access to wholesale funding deteriorated in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting tighter financial market conditions for banks. Banks reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programmes and the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) continued to have a positive impact on their liquidity position and market financing conditions. They expect this impact to become smaller in the case of TLTROs and negative for the ECB’s asset purchase programmes over the next six months. Banks also indicated that the ECB’s asset purchases programmes and the negative deposit facility rate (DFR) had a negative impact on their profitability, mainly via net interest income. This effect was mitigated by the ECB’s two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings and by TLTRO III. The ECB’s asset purchases, the negative DFR and TLTRO III had a continued net easing impact on lending conditions and a positive impact on lending volumes, but generally less than previously reported. Banks expect the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programmes to turn into a net tightening for lending conditions and a mostly negative impact for loan volumes over the next six months. For the negative DFR and TLTRO III, the net easing impact on bank lending conditions and the positive impact on lending volumes are generally expected to become weaker.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the April 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the first quarter of 2022 and expected changes in the second quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The April 2022 survey round was conducted between 7 March and 22 March 2022. A total of 151 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Combined fiscal and monetary response kept financial fragmentation in check during pandemic
Resilient financial integration vital for euro area economy and financial sector
EU equity markets need further promotion to finance green and digital transformations
The financial fragmentation in the euro area that occurred at the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was reversed relatively quickly, the European Central Bank (ECB)’s latest report on Financial Integration and Structure in the Euro Area shows. Once pre-pandemic levels of integration were regained, financial integration increased further and remained resilient to pressure from further waves of infections. The most influential policy interventions that initially kept fragmentation contained, and then brought integration back to pre-pandemic levels, were the series of ECB monetary policy measures and the European Union (EU) agreement on a sizeable coronavirus recovery fund.
The biennial ECB Financial Integration and Structure in the Euro Area report focuses on financial integration, changes in financial structure and the process of financial development and modernisation. It also discusses selected financial sector policies, notably those related to the European banking union and capital markets union. In this way, the report contributes to the debate on how European Economic and Monetary Union can be deepened.
Thanks to decisive policy responses, financing of euro area firms and households held up during the pandemic, although this required a significant increase in public debt. In addition to fiscal support and guarantees, another factor that helped non-financial corporations to stabilise was a rapid shift in their financing mix towards bank credit lines and corporate debt issuance, which was also facilitated by monetary policy measures. The rise in non-bank financial intermediation continued, with especially strong growth in investment funds, most notably in equity funds.
The coronavirus crisis substantially restricted private consumption risk sharing across euro area countries, consequently limiting one of the benefits of financial integration and development. The major fiscal initiatives at the EU level, such as the NextGenerationEU recovery programme and the three safety nets for businesses, jobs and workers, were key to ensuring risk sharing among member countries and compensating for hampered private financial channels.
The NextGenerationEU programme provides a unique historical opportunity to bring private risk capital markets in the euro area and EU to levels similar to those in other major economies. Enhanced private forces would have to join public ones to ensure sufficient innovation and prepare the ground for financing the green, digital and other technological transformations. The coronavirus pandemic and recent geopolitical events have further underlined the need to accelerate the EU’s green and digital “twin transition”.
Completing the banking union and making material progress with the capital markets union remain important.
Implementation of the 2020 capital markets union action plan ­­– in particular the digital European Single Access Point and the reviews of EU public listing rules and of fund and insurance regulations – could produce tangible progress in the development and integration of European public and private equity markets. This is because the plan’s implementation is an important contribution to enabling the large technological transformations that are needed. The path of making insolvency frameworks more efficient and harmonised across member countries also needs to be continued. Even more effort will be necessary to build a vibrant EU equity ecosystem – for example, to facilitate the scale-up phase of successful companies.
Debt issuance procedures also need to be further integrated and harmonised to reduce costs and allow investors to better diversify across EU countries. As domestic and cross-border bank consolidation could help address structurally low profitability and fragmentation in retail credit markets, removing remaining regulatory obstacles should be considered.
A statistical (online) annex has been released alongside this report. Since March 2020, the ECB has released, on a biannual basis, a streamlined set of indicators covering both financial integration and financial structure.

Citizens want universally accepted payment methods in online and physical stores across Europe
Users prefer instant and contactless person-to-person payments
High safety and security standards seen as fundamental for digital payment methods
The European Central Bank (ECB) published today the findings of its commissioned research on citizens’ payment habits and their attitudes towards digital payments in order to gain a deeper understanding of user preferences as part of the digital euro project.
Based on the responses of focus groups and online communities across all euro area countries, the report shows a strong preference for payment methods with pan-European reach and universal acceptance in physical shops and online. Users favour payment solutions that are convenient, fast and easy to use. Participants valued the possibility of instant and contactless person-to-person payments, regardless of the platform or device. Focus group respondents also wished for a one-stop-solution that would incorporate all the current payment options into one system.
Safety and security were a concern among respondents, who sought guarantees against fraud and hacking, as well as secure and reliable payment authentication methods. Biometric methods of payment verification, such as those involving iris scan technology, were widely supported by participants, while flexible and adjustable privacy settings were seen as desirable.
“We want the digital euro to add value for end users and merit their confidence,” says ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta, Chair of the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. “A digital euro could enhance European payments by providing a universally accepted and secure solution that facilitates contactless and instant payments.”
Participants demonstrated little knowledge of the digital euro, but they generally agreed that banks and/or central banks would be the safest and most reliable providers. They also expressed the view that a digital euro should not undermine cash.
These findings will feed into the ongoing digital euro investigation phase, which is expected to conclude in October 2023.
Conducted from October 2021 to December 2021, this qualitative research gathered contributions from: (i) members of the general public, (ii) people with knowledge of technology, (iii) small and micro merchants and retailers, and (iv) individuals with limited access to banking services or the internet.

ECB and Narodowy Bank Polski set up new €10 billion swap line until 15 January 2023
ECB extends existing temporary repo lines with non-euro area central banks to 15 January 2023 following central banks’ extension requests
Euro liquidity lines address possible liquidity needs in non-euro area countries given uncertainty from Russian invasion of Ukraine and regional spillover risk, while having full regard to EU sanctions
The European Central Bank (ECB) and Narodowy Bank Polski have agreed to set up a precautionary swap line to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in Poland.
The ECB has also decided to extend its temporary bilateral repo lines to the central banks of Hungary, Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia and the Republic of San Marino. The size of the individual agreements will remain unchanged. These bilateral lines were established in 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in those countries via their central banks. The lines were due to expire at the end of March 2022, as they were specifically aimed at addressing possible euro liquidity needs in the presence of market dysfunctions due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Following requests from the central banks and based on a positive case-by-case assessment by the Governing Council, these swap and repo lines have been granted until 15 January 2023. In the context of heightened geopolitical tensions triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the lines are designed to prevent spillover effects in euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. At the same time, full regard has been given to the applicable EU sanctions, with which the ECB expects its counterparties to comply, so that the lines are not used to circumvent the sanctions.
Temporary agreements complement the ECB’s standing swap lines and EUREP repo agreements. The EUREP facility was extended to 15 January 2023 as part of ECB’s monetary policy decisions of 10 March 2022.
Under the new swap line, Narodowy Bank Polski will be able to borrow up to €10 billion from the ECB in exchange for Polish zloty.
Under their respective repo line agreements:
The Magyar Nemzeti Bank can borrow up to €4 billion from the ECB
Banka e Shqipërisë (Bank of Albania) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
Народна банка на Република Северна Македонија (National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
Banca Centrale della Repubblica di San Marino (Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino) can borrow up to €100 million from the ECB
Under a repo line, a national central bank can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.

Pandemic collateral easing measures introduced in April 2020 will be gradually phased out in three steps between July 2022 and March 2024
Step-wise phasing out of measures will gradually restore Eurosystem’s pre-pandemic risk tolerance and avoid collateral availability cliff effects
ECB will continue to waive minimum credit quality requirement for GGBs, allowing NCBs to accept them as collateral in line with continued eligibility in PEPP
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to gradually phase out the package of pandemic collateral easing measures in place since April 2020. The Governing Council has taken into account in a forward-looking manner the impact of this gradual phasing out on the collateral availability of Eurosystem counterparties, in particular with regard to their ability to continue mobilising collateral until the maturity of the outstanding targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III). Moreover, it has considered the risk impact of each of these measures. This gradual phasing out allows ample time for the Eurosystem’s counterparties to adapt, and is scheduled to take place in the following three steps.
Step 1 From 8 July 2022 the ECB will implement a set of decisions. First, it will halve the temporary reduction in collateral valuation haircuts across all assets from the current 20% adjustment to 10%. Second, the ECB will no longer maintain the eligibility of marketable assets that fulfilled minimum credit quality requirements on 7 April 2020 but whose credit ratings subsequently deteriorated below the minimum rating threshold. Third, the ECB will restore the limit with respect to unsecured debt instruments issued by any single other banking group in a credit institution’s collateral pool from 10% to 2.5%, as was the case before April 2020. Fourth, the ECB will phase out the temporary easing of certain technical requirements for the eligibility of additional credit claims (ACC), mainly relating to fully restoring the frequency of the ACC loan level reporting requirements and the acceptance requirements for banks’ own credit assessments from internal rating-based systems. The relevant national central banks will communicate the details to the affected counterparties.
Step 2 In June 2023 the ECB expects to implement a new valuation haircut schedule based on its pre-pandemic risk tolerance level for credit operations, phasing out the remaining general 10% reduction in collateral valuation haircuts. Details of the new haircut schedule will be announced in due course and will take into account the results of the forthcoming regular review of the ECB risk control framework.
Step 3 In March 2024 the ECB will in principle phase out the remaining pandemic collateral easing measures, following a comprehensive review of the ACC frameworks that will take into account counterparties’ collateral needs for their continued participation in the outstanding TLTRO III operations until December 2024. These measures include the acceptance of various ACCs introduced during the pandemic period, such as loans guaranteed by the government and certain public sector entities.
Notwithstanding this, national central banks may decide to terminate (parts of) their ACC framework early.
The Governing Council has decided to continue to allow NCBs to accept as eligible collateral Greek government bonds (GGBs) that do not satisfy the Eurosystem’s minimum credit quality requirements but fulfil all other applicable eligibility criteria, for at least as long as reinvestments in GGBs under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) continue.

The ECB’s Governing Council reserves the right to deviate also in the future from credit rating agencies’ ratings if warranted, in line with its discretion under the monetary policy framework, thereby avoiding mechanistic reliance on these ratings.
The ECB’s Governing Council adopted the underlying package of temporary collateral easing measures in April 2020 as part of its policy response to the pandemic, to facilitate the availability of eligible collateral for Eurosystem counterparties and to mitigate the effect on collateral availability of possible rating downgrades resulting from the economic fallout from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a watershed for Europe. The Governing Council expresses its full support to the people of Ukraine. It will ensure smooth liquidity conditions and implement the sanctions decided by the European Union and European governments. The Governing Council will take whatever action is needed to fulfil the ECB’s mandate to pursue price stability and to safeguard financial stability.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Based on its updated assessment and taking into account the uncertain environment, the Governing Council today revised the purchase schedule for its APP for the coming months. Monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in April, €30 billion in May and €20 billion in June. The calibration of net purchases for the third quarter will be data-dependent and reflect its evolving assessment of the outlook. If the incoming data support the expectation that the medium-term inflation outlook will not weaken even after the end of its net asset purchases, the Governing Council will conclude net purchases under the APP in the third quarter. If the medium-term inflation outlook changes and if financing conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards the 2% target, the Governing Council stands ready to revise its schedule for net asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
Any adjustments to the key ECB interest rates will take place some time after the end of the Governing Council’s net purchases under the APP and will be gradual. The path for the key ECB interest rates will continue to be determined by the Governing Council’s forward guidance and by its strategic commitment to stabilise inflation at 2% over the medium term. Accordingly, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council is conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
Liquidity lines with non-euro area central banks
In view of the highly uncertain environment caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the risk of regional spillovers that could adversely affect euro area financial markets, the Governing Council decided to extend the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) until 15 January 2023. EUREP will therefore continue to complement the regular euro liquidity-providing arrangements for non-euro area central banks. Together, these form a comprehensive set of backstop facilities to address possible euro liquidity needs in the event of market dysfunctions outside the euro area that could adversely affect the smooth transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. Requests from non-euro area central banks for individual euro liquidity lines will be assessed by the Governing Council on a case-by-case basis.

Financing conditions in securities financing markets continued to ease for most collateral types, but credit conditions in OTC derivatives markets tightened
Market-making activities had decreased for both debt securities and derivatives over the past year but were expected to broadly increase in 2022
Market participants expressed very low confidence in their ability to act as market-makers for corporate bonds in times of stress
As for securities financing transactions, survey participants reported a continued easing of financing conditions. This overall tendency could be seen in the net percentages reporting slightly higher or unchanged maximum amounts, the maximum maturity of funding for most types of euro-denominated collateral, and in decreasing rates/spreads for funding against most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral had increased slightly or were unchanged for almost all types of collateral. Respondents also reported weaker demand for funding for most collateral types.
Turning to non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, respondents reported that initial margin requirements had increased slightly for many types of OTC derivative, and that liquidity and trading had deteriorated for many OTC derivative types.
The overall credit terms and conditions offered by banks to counterparties tightened slightly over the period from September to November 2021. A small net percentage of respondents reported less favourable overall credit terms for all counterparty types. While price terms tightened across the board, non-price terms tightened only for insurance companies and non-financial corporations. The overall tightening continues the development reported in previous quarters but contrasts with the expectations expressed in the last survey. Looking ahead, a small net percentage of respondents to the December survey expected a further tightening of price terms for all types of counterparty over the period from December 2021 to February 2022, while non-price terms were expected to ease for most types of counterparty.
The December 2021 survey included a number of special questions about market-making activities. Survey respondents reported that market-making activities had decreased for many types of debt security and derivative over the past year, but were expected to broadly increase in 2022. Respondents cited competition from other banks as the main driver of changes in market-making activities over the last year and willingness to take on risk as the main driver of expected changes in market-making activities in the year ahead. Respondents expressed confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for many asset classes – broadly confirming their assessment of the past two years – with the important exception of corporate bonds, for which they expressed very low confidence. Compared with the December 2020 survey, more respondents reported a “very limited” or “limited” ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for the categories “other government bonds” (i.e. lower quality government bonds) and “high-yield corporate bonds”.
The December 2021 SESFOD survey, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the ECB’s website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD survey is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The December 2021 survey collected qualitative information on changes between September and November 2021. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

ECB profit €0.2 billion (2020: €1.6 billion) after €0.6 billion transfer to provision for financial risks
Profit distributed to euro area national central banks
Net interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes €1.0 billion (2020: €1.3 billion)
ECB’s Balance Sheet grows to €680 billion (2020: €569 billion)
The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) audited financial statements for 2021 show that profit for the year was €192 million (2020: €1,643 million). The €1,452 million decrease compared to the previous year was mainly due to lower income from foreign reserve assets and from securities held for monetary policy purposes, as well as a transfer to the provision for financial risks. The Governing Council decided to transfer €610 million to the provision for financial risks in response to higher risk exposure stemming mainly from the continued purchases of monetary policy securities.
Net interest income totalled €1,566 million in 2021 (2020: €2,017 million). Net interest income on foreign reserve assets decreased to €197 million (2020: €474 million) owing to lower interest income earned on the US dollar portfolio. Net interest income arising from securities held for monetary policy purposes decreased to €1,006 million (2020: €1,337 million), mainly owing to negative interest income from the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
Write-downs amounted to €133 million (2020: €26 million), mainly stemming from unrealised price losses on securities held in the US dollar and own funds portfolios.
Impairment tests are conducted on the securities held by the ECB in its monetary policy portfolios, which are valued at amortised cost (subject to impairment). Based on the results of these tests, no impairment losses have been recorded for these portfolios.
Total staff costs increased to €674 million (2020: €646 million) as a result of higher costs relating to post-employment benefits arising from the annual actuarial valuation and the higher average number of staff. Other administrative expenses increased to €564 million (2020: €553 million), mainly owing to an increase in property maintenance expenses.
Supervisory fee income, derived from fees charged to recover expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its supervisory tasks, amounted to €578 million (2020: €535 million). The increase in 2021 was driven by the continuing development of banking supervision-related IT systems and higher staff costs.
The ECB’s profit is distributed to the euro area national central banks (NCBs). The Governing Council decided to make an interim profit distribution of €150 million on 31 January 2022. At yesterday’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to distribute the remainder of the profit, amounting to €42 million, on 18 February 2022.
The total size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €111 billion to €680 billion (2020: €569 billion). This increase was mainly due to securities purchased under the PEPP and the asset purchase programme (APP).
At the end of 2021 the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises assets and liabilities of the euro area NCBs and of the ECB vis-à-vis third parties, stood at €8,566 billion (2020: €6,978 billion). The growth compared to the previous year was mainly due to securities purchased under the PEPP and the APP and the increase in Eurosystem refinancing operations as a result of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III).
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes rose by €1,019 billion to €4,713 billion (2020: €3,694 billion). The APP holdings increased by €214 billion to €3,123 billion and the PEPP holdings increased by €827 billion to €1,581 billion.

FX Global Code promotes robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market
European System of Central Banks publicly reaffirms commitment to updated Code
Code first published in 2017 and updated mid-2021
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) welcomes the July 2021 update of the FX Global Code and the publication of related guidance material. With this global code on foreign exchange, participants in foreign exchange markets aim to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open and appropriately transparent foreign exchange market underpinned by high ethical standards. The Code has been updated by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee to keep it relevant and aligned with the ongoing evolution of the foreign exchange market and will continue to set the standard for good market practice. Well-functioning financial markets benefit all market participants and are important to central banks because they ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. This ultimately benefits the public at large.
Today all members of the ESCB, including the European Central Bank (ECB), simultaneously issued renewed Statements of Commitment to the Code. This demonstrates their strong commitment to adhere to its principles when acting as foreign exchange market participants, to align their internal practices and processes with its updated principles, and to support and promote adherence to the Code. With these Statements of Commitment, they emphasise that the principles of the Code are important in ensuring the continued integrity and effective functioning of the foreign exchange market. To fully achieve the objective of the Code, the EU central banks also encourage foreign exchange market participants in their jurisdictions to review the updated Code and renew their Statements of Commitment.

The quarterly data cover information required for the analysis of the EU banking sector, comprising a subset of the information that is available in the year-end dataset. The end-September 2021 data refer to 323 banking groups and 2,511 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector balance sheet. This dataset includes an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Reporters generally apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting of the European Banking Authority. However some medium-sized and small reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.

HICP inflation expectations revised up, particularly for 2022
Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged but expected temporary slower growth around the start of 2022
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2022, HICP inflation expectations stood at 3.0%, 1.8% and 1.9% for 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. Compared with the previous round for the fourth quarter of 2021, expectations were revised up by 1.1 percentage points for 2022 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2023 (expectations for 2024 were not surveyed in the previous round). Respondents attributed the upward revisions mainly to further increases in energy prices and the ongoing impact of demand-supply imbalances. At the same time, they continue to expect inflation to fall – to 1.8% by December 2022. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 2.0%, revised up from 1.9% in the previous round.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents’ expectations were largely unchanged, with counteracting revisions for 2022 (downwards) and 2023 (upwards). Based on their profile of expected quarter-on-quarter growth between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2022, respondents expect the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to result in temporarily slower economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 but a rebound in the second and third quarters of 2022. Overall, growth expectations continue to imply that economic activity exceeded its pre-pandemic level (fourth quarter of 2019) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Respondents now expect the level of GDP to rise above the path expected before the pandemic in 2023 (compared with 2024 in the previous round). Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were unchanged at 1.5%.
Unemployment rate expectations were revised down by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points for all horizons. SPF respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 7.2% in 2022 to 6.7% by 2026. Longer-term unemployment expectations are at their lowest level for 15 years."

The Governing Council confirmed the decisions taken at its monetary policy meeting last December.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council is conducting net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council’s efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the Governing Council’s mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
In line with the step-by-step reduction in asset purchases decided on in December 2021 and to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at the Governing Council’s target over the medium term, monthly net purchases under the APP will amount to €40 billion in the second quarter of 2022 and €30 billion in the third quarter. From October onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates. The Governing Council expects net purchases to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.

The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric 2% inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June this year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards tightened slightly for firms and remained unchanged for housing loans
Banks continue to hold overall benign view of firm credit risks, owing mainly to positive assessment of economic outlook
Strong increase in loan demand by firms, driven by higher working capital needs stemming from supply bottlenecks, as well as by financing for longer-term investment
According to the January 2022 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises tightened very slightly (net percentage of banks standing at 2%, see Chart 1) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported unchanged credit standards (net percentage of 0%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households eased moderately (net percentage of -4%). Banks had a generally benign view of firms’ and households’ credit risks based on an overall positive assessment of the economic outlook, despite the current pandemic situation and the dampening impact of supply bottlenecks. In the first quarter of 2022, banks expect credit standards to remain broadly unchanged for loans to firms, to tighten moderately for housing loans and to ease further for consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –were broadly unchanged for loans to firms and loans to households in the fourth quarter of 2021. For margins on average loans, banks continued to report a narrowing in net terms for loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase, whereas margins on riskier loans widened for these loan categories. For consumer credit and other lending to households, both margins on average and riskier loans remained broadly unchanged.
Banks reported, on balance, a considerable increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Chart 2), driven by a stronger positive contribution of firms’
financing needs for both working capital and fixed investment compared with the previous quarter. In addition, banks continued to report a positive impact on loan demand from other financing needs, which include M&A activity and debt refinancing and restructuring. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households increased in net terms in the fourth quarter of 2021. Consumer confidence and the low general level of interest rates continued to support the demand for loans to households across loan categories. In addition, housing market prospects had a positive impact on the demand for housing loans, whereas spending on durables had a small negative impact on consumer credit. In the first quarter of 2022, banks expect net demand to continue to increase for loans to firms and households.
According to the banks surveyed, access to retail funding continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, banks reported that supervisory and regulatory actions had a positive effect on their capital position in 2021. At the same time, euro area banks’ non-performing loan (NPL) ratios had a small net tightening impact on credit standards for loans to enterprises and for consumer credit, whereas the impact continued to be neutral on credit standards for loans to households for house purchase in the second half of 2021. Across the main economic sectors, euro area banks indicated moderately tightened or broadly unchanged credit standards for new loans to enterprises. Finally, euro area banks reported that COVID-19 related government guarantees continued to support banks’ credit standards for loans to firms in the second half of 2021. Demand for loans with COVID-19 related government guarantees declined on balance, while it increased for loans without such guarantees.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the January 2022 survey relate to changes observed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expected changes in the first quarter of 2022, unless otherwise indicated. The January 2022 survey round was conducted between 13 December 2021 and 11 January 2022. A total of 152 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

347,000 counterfeit euro banknotes withdrawn from circulation in 2021, a historically low level in proportion to banknotes in circulation
About two-thirds of total withdrawn counterfeits were €20 and €50 banknotes
Euro banknotes remain a trusted and safe means of payment
Authenticity of euro banknotes can be verified using “feel, look and tilt” method
Some 347,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2021 (180,000 in the second half of the year), a decrease of 24.6% when compared with 2020. €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for about two-thirds of the total. 95.4% of counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 4.2% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 0.4% in other parts of the world.
There is little likelihood of receiving a counterfeit, as the number of counterfeits remains very low in proportion to the number of genuine euro banknotes in circulation. In 2021, 12 counterfeits were detected per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation, which is a historically low level (see the chart below).
Low-quality reproductions are continuously withdrawn from circulation. Counterfeits are easy to detect as they have no security features, or only very poor imitations of them. The public does not need to be concerned about counterfeiting, but should nevertheless remain vigilant. You can check your notes by using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described in the dedicated section of the ECB’s website and on the websites of the national central banks of the euro area. The Eurosystem also helps professional cash handlers by ensuring that banknote-handling and processing machines can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation.
Using counterfeits for payments is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution. If you receive a suspect banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting.
The Eurosystem has a duty to safeguard the integrity of euro banknotes and to continue improving banknote technology. The second series of banknotes – the Europa series – is even more secure and is helping to maintain public trust in the currency.

The Governing Council, the General Council, the Executive Board and the staff of the European Central Bank are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament.
Mr Sassoli was a dedicated European, a passionate President of the European Parliament since 2019, and a fighter for European democracy and human rights. As an MEP since 2009, he worked tirelessly for a more united and socially conscious Europe with citizens at its centre. His kindness and humility will be sorely missed.
“I am grieving President Sassoli’s passing. Europe has lost a leader and a tireless defender of European values,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The ECB wishes to send its heartfelt condolences to Mr Sassoli’s family and to his friends and colleagues, and is flying its flags at half-mast in his honour.

17 November 1997,"At its meeting of 4 November 1997, the Council of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) considered the question of the date for the introduction of the euro banknotes. After evaluating the different options, the Council of the EMI agreed that the euro banknotes should be introduced on 1 January 2002. This agreement was forwarded to the Council of the European Union; the Governing Council of the European Central Bank will be notified accordingly.
The Council of the EMI is confident that the early release of its view on the date for the introduction of the euro banknotes will help all parties concerned in their preparations for the changeover to the euro."
27 October 1997,"The Treaty establishing the European Community obliges the EU Member States to make their national legislation, inclusive of the statutes of their respective central banks, compatible with Treaty requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union. The EMI reported on the adaptation of national legislation in its Convergence Reports dated November 1995 (prepared in accordance with Article 7 of its Statute) and November 1996 (prepared in accordance with Article 109j (1) of the Treaty), focusing on the adaptation of statutes of national central banks. In the light of ongoing initiatives for legal changes in member countries, it has now prepared an up-date of the information on legal convergence, describing progress made until August 1997. Since then, further legislative action has been initiated in some EU Member States, which is not covered in the update.
This update will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It will also be available upon request from the EMI, at the following address:"
24 September 1997,"The European Monetary Institute (EMI) will today publish an updated information brochure, which presents the tasks and structure of the Institute. The brochure replaces the booklet entitled the ""Role and functions of the European Monetary Institute"", which was issued in February 1996. The new brochure is currently available in English. French and German versions will be published soon.
Copies of the brochure can be obtained free of charge by contacting the EMIs Press Office at the following address:"
23 September 1997,"The European Monetary Institute (EMI) is today publishing a report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"". The report contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments and procedures prepared by the EMI to be submitted to the European Central Bank (ECB) after its establishment. The report expands on, and updates, the material included in the EMI report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: Specification of the operational framework"" (published on 10 January 1997).
The new report is intended particularly to provide financial institutions with the information they need to prepare themselves to participate in ESCB monetary policy operations in Stage Three of EMU. In this respect, the report first sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by financial institutions to be eligible counterparties to ESCB monetary policy operations. It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB (the main refinancing operations, the longer-term refinancing operations, fine-tuning operations, and structural operations) and of the ESCB's two standing facilities (the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility). The report contains a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations. Furthermore, the report specifies the eligibility criteria and risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB's liquidity-providing operations. Finally, the report presents the features of the ESCB's minimum reserves system as prepared by the EMI.
In relation to the EMI report of January 1997, the present report includes further specification particularly in the following areas: · tender and settlement procedures, as well as procedures for bilateral transactions, to be applied in the ESCB's open market operations; · procedures for counterparties' access to the standing facilities and for settling transactions under the standing facilities; · eligibility criteria, risk control measures and valuation principles to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB's liquidity-providing operations; · features of the ESCB's minimum reserves system; · provisions to be applied in the transition from the national monetary policies in Stage Two to the single monetary policy in Stage Three.
It should be noted that the final decision on the operational framework for the single monetary policy will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB after its establishment. The Governing Council of the ECB may decide not to use all the available options or may change certain features of the instruments and procedures presented in the report.
The report will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It will also be available from the EMI, at the following address:"
18 September 1997,"According to the Implementation Package published by the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in July 1996, a provisional List of Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) is to be compiled in 1997 and must be fully operational in early 1998.
The List of MFIs will facilitate the production of a comprehensive and consistent balance sheet of the money-creating sector in the single currency area and will serve other important applications like ESA95 . It is primarily for the use of reporting institutions and compilers of statistics.
For this purpose, a provisional database has been developed by the EMI. At present the provisional List of MFIs includes approximately 10,000 financial institutions, as at the end of 1996.
It should be emphasised that the provisional List of MFIs provides as homogeneous a population as possible for the whole European Union for statistical purposes in accordance with the MFI definition . Following this definition, central banks have provided information on Credit Institutions as defined in Community Law. The selection of other MFIs, such as Money Market Funds (MMFs), is in the process of being carried out.
The final List of MFIs will be published by March 1998 at the latest. Following the release of the final List of MFIs, procedures for monitoring and continuous checking will be put in place to ensure that the List remains up-to-date, accurate, as homogeneous as possible and sufficiently stable for statistical purposes.
Copies of the provisional list will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It will also be available from the EMI, at the following address:"
16 September 1997,"The European Monetary Institute (EMI) is today publishing a report entitled: Second progress report on the TARGET Project"".
This report provides information on recent progress made in various organisational aspects and in the technical implementation of the TARGET system, the real-time gross settlement arrangement for large value cross-border euro payments in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The report expands on, and updates, material included in two previous reports, The TARGET system"" (released in May 1995) and The First Progress Report on the TARGET Project"" (released in August 1996).In particular the report provides additional information on issues concerning: 1) operating time; 2) pricing policies; and 3) provision of settlement services to net settlement systems. An updated version of certain technical annexes (Interlinking Specification, Data Dictionary and Minimum common performance features of RTGS systems within TARGET) and a technical annex concerning end-of-day procedures in TARGET will be available at the EMI and the national central banks (NCBs) at the request of interested parties.
The reference time for TARGET will be European Central Bank (ECB)"" time, i.e. the time of the place where the ECB is located. The normal TARGET operating hours will be from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. ECB time, but some flexibility could be left to the NCBs to open their domestic real-time gross-settlement (RTGS) systems earlier, for particular domestic reasons.
Apart from Saturdays and Sundays, there will be two common holidays for TARGET: Christmas Day and New Year's Day. On other days, the TARGET system will be open, although flexibility will be left to NCBs to close their domestic systems during national holidays when the law or the banking communities so require.
As regards pricing policy for TARGET, it has been agreed that a common transaction fee for cross-border TARGET transfers will be charged, based on the principle of full cost recovery and in line with EU competition policy. The fee will be set within the range of 1.50 to 3.00 euro. The exact fee will be decided by the ECB Governing Council. Settlement services to the EBA Clearing System will be provided by the ECB in Stage Three. NCBs may also open a settlement account for the EBA in their own books.
The test phase of TARGET started mid-June 1997, slightly ahead of schedule; the simulation phase will begin in July 1998."
9 September 1997,"Mr. W.F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), wrote yesterday to the signatories of the ""Joint statement on market conventions for the euro"" of 16 July 1997."
15 July 1997,The EMI recognises the need for a distinctive codified symbol for the single currency and supports the logo proposed by the European Commission as a symbol for the euro.
10 July 1997,"As part of its responsibility for preparing for the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the EMI has developed the designs for the seven denominations in the euro banknote series (EURO 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500).
The designs released in July 1997 represent updated versions of the design sketches selected by the EMI Council in December 1996. For security reasons, the illustrations of the designs which are now available do not show all the details and security features that will ultimately be incorporated into the euro banknotes. The final banknote designs will thus differ from these sketches in several important respects.
I. PROCESS TO SELECT THE INITIAL DESIGN SKETCHES
The initial design sketches were selected in eight steps:"
10 July 1997,"The designs chosen by the EMI Council are inspired by the theme ""Ages and styles of Europe"". The winning designs, produced by Mr. Robert Kalina of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, depict the prevailing architectural style during seven ""ages"" in Europe's cultural history - Classical, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo, the age of iron and glass architecture, and modern 20th century architecture - and emphasise three main architectural elements: windows, gateways and bridges.
The designs were selected because they blend the historical development of the technical, artistic and communication fields in Europe in one harmonious composition, and epitomise the dawn of the new common Europe with its common cultural heritage, and the vision of a common future in the next century, indeed, the new millennium.
Windows and gateways form the principal element of the front side of each banknote and symbolise the spirit of openness and co-operation in the European Union. In addition, the twelve stars of the EU are also featured, representing the dynamism and harmony of contemporary Europe.
To complement these design elements, the reverse side of each banknote features a bridge typical of the respective age of European development. These range from pre-Christian constructions to the sophisticated suspension bridges of the modern era. Bridges are used as a metaphor for communication both among the people of Europe, and also between Europe and the rest of the world.
The other main aspects that are depicted on the banknotes are:"
10 July 1997,"On 13 December 1996 the draft design series chosen by the EMI Council for the seven denominations in the euro banknote series were published. As explained at the time, it is standard procedure to adjust and refine such design sketches before they are fully suitable for origination and printing.
In line with the timetable, the modifications to the main design features have been made. In particular, the architectural features have been amended with a view to avoiding any obvious references to existing structures. For security reasons, the illustrations of the designs which are now available do not show all the details and security features that will ultimately be incorporated into the euro banknotes. The final banknote designs will thus differ from these sketches in several respects.
The designs will now form the basis of further technical work which will enable the ESCB to put the euro banknotes into circulation by 1 January 2002, at the latest."
2 July 1997,"1. BANKNOTE PRINTING IN EU MEMBER STATES
Thirteen EU Member States have their own banknote printing works. In eight countries these printing works are part of the national central bank (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom). In two countries (Finland and Sweden), the printing works take the form of limited companies wholly owned by the national central bank. In Spain banknote printing is taken care of by a public company external to the central bank (the Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre). In the Netherlands, banknotes are printed by a private company (Enschedé). Finally, in Germany, the Bundesbank has two suppliers: the Bundesdruckerei (a public company whose printing works is located in Berlin) and Giesecke & Devrient (a private company based in Munich).
These 14 printing works produced approximately 9 billion banknotes in 1996:"
2 July 1997,"The EMI considers that it is important to reach the highest possible degree of acceptance by all users of the euro banknotes, including the blind and partially sighted. Fundamental to the independence of blind and partially sighted people is their ability to deal easily with money.
Numerous banknotes in EU countries currently incorporate marks enabling the blind and partially sighted to distinguish between denominations. Design features useful for people with partial sight are also often helpful to, and welcomed by, fully sighted people.
The current population of the European Union is about 370 million, of which close to 2% (about 7 million) have a significant visual disability.
Visual impairment is one of the most age-related of disabilities; the vast majority of blind and partially sighted people are elderly. Demographic trends show that the number of elderly people is on the increase.
The EMI had a fruitful co-operation with the European Blind Union. Design specifications for partially sighted people were included in the euro banknote design process from the outset, in order to obviate the need for later changes which would have been less efficient.
The needs of the blind and partially sighted have essentially been catered for by four different ways of differentiating between euro banknote denominations:
1. DIFFERENT SIZES OF THE BANKNOTES
In order to facilitate identification of the different denominations by the blind, the euro banknotes have different sizes according to their denomination.
EURO 5: 120 mm x 62 mm
EURO 10: 127 mm x 67 mm
EURO 20: 133 mm x 72 mm
EURO 50: 140 mm x 77 mm
EURO 100: 147 mm x 82 mm
EURO 200: 153 mm x 82 mm
EURO 500: 160 mm x 82 mm"
2 July 1997,"1. SUMMARY
The procedure to select the designs was characterised by the following key points:"
2 July 1997,"Under Article 105a (1) of the Treaty on European Union (commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty), the European Central Bank (ECB) will have the exclusive right to authorise the issue of banknotes within the Member States participating in the euro area. The ECB and the national central banks will issue such banknotes, which shall be the only banknotes with legal tender status.
Given the long lead times necessary to produce the euro banknotes, the EMI is undertaking a number of preparatory activities, in line with its responsibility under Article 109f (3) of the Treaty, to supervise the technical preparation of the euro banknotes. To this end, a Working Group on Printing and Issuing a European Banknote has been set up which reports to the EMI Council on all issues of preparatory work in the banknote area. All relevant items on which the EMI Council has reached agreement will be submitted for decision to the Governing Council of the ECB.
The changeover scenario adopted by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995 provides for the production of euro banknotes to start in 1998 following a decision by the ECB, which will also announce, before 1 January 1999, the precise date on which the euro banknotes will be put into circulation. Euro banknotes will be put into circulation by 1 January 2002, at the latest.
The right to issue euro coins lies with the Member States, although the size of the issue requires the approval of the ECB. The EU Finance Ministers (the ECOFIN Council) have entrusted the handling of technical problems associated with the production of euro coins to the Working Group of Mint Directors, which comprises the heads of the Mints in all the EU countries.
The Amsterdam European Council meeting (June 1997) endorsed the choice of the design for the common side of the euro coins and welcomed the fact that ""this provides a tangible sign to citizens of the preparation of the euro"". It also invited the ECOFIN Council to adopt the draft Regulation defining the denominations and technical specifications of the euro coins. There will be eight euro coins ranging from one cent to EURO 2. The draft Regulation follows detailed consultation of consumer groups (in particular the blind and partially sighted) and representatives of the vending machine industry. It also reflects a considerable amount of preparatory work by the Working Group of Mint Directors, which has liaised with the EMI's Banknote Working Group in this connection so as to ensure that preparatory work on the euro banknotes and on the euro coins can progress in parallel to the greatest possible extent."
2 July 1997,"Modern reproduction technology offers the opportunity to produce, even on easily available low-price devices, fairly good copies of any printed picture. Therefore, banknotes need to be very well protected against counterfeiting by using a variety of security features which are especially designed to enhance the possibility of easily recognising counterfeit banknotes.
One of the most important security features is still the special banknote paper containing e.g. fluorescent fibres and a multitone watermark; the imitation of the watermark requires additional work from the counterfeiter because it cannot easily be reproduced either by copying or by printing.
In addition, the euro banknotes will be provided with a number of advanced security features for the public to ensure that they will be at least as well protected against counterfeiting as existing national banknotes.
Among these are paper-based (e.g. security thread), printed (e.g. intaglio printing) and non-print features (e.g. diffractive or reflective foils).
In addition, machine-readable features will be integrated into the euro banknotes to enable the central banks and the vending and note-handling machine industry to verify authenticity reliably.
These security features should enable a person to identify a counterfeit with a minimum of careful attention. The ECB and the national central banks will take great care in making known to the general public the relevant security features of the euro banknotes before and after they are put into circulation."
1 July 1997,"Dr. Willem Frederik Duisenberg, former Governor of De Nederlandsche Bank, took office as President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) in Frankfurt am Main on Tuesday, 1 July 1997. Dr. Duisenberg was appointed by the European Council in Dublin on 13 December 1996. He succeeds Baron Alexandre Lamfalussy, who was President of the EMI from 1 January 1994 until 30 June 1997."
25 April 1997,"The European Monetary Institute welcomes the decision of the Maintenance Agency for ISO 4217, the body responsible for the issuance of currency codes, to attribute the code ""EUR"" to the euro. This new code has been issued now so that technical preparations for the single currency can be started. It is intended for use in any application of trade, commerce and banking which is based on uniform, internationally agreed representations of currencies.
The code ""EUR"" will allow currency users to easily identify the new currency. The early attribution of the currency code ""EUR"" will help economic agents, in particular financial institutions, in their preparatory work for the introduction of the single currency on 1 January 1999."

All recommendations of independent review addressed
Action plan has six workstreams
Eurosystem will implement majority of measures by end of 2022
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published an action plan to address the recommendations of an independent review mandated by the ECB’s Governing Council in November 2020, following the five major incidents that affected TARGET2 and TARGET2 Securities in 2020. The action plan also addresses recommendations issued by the Eurosystem oversight function and the Internal Audit Committee in relation to these incidents.
In December 2020 the ECB appointed Deloitte to conduct an independent review of the five major IT-related incidents (which were not cyber-related). In July 2021 the ECB published the results of Deloitte’s review and the Eurosystem’s response, in which the Eurosystem accepted the general conclusions and recommendations of the review and committed to addressing them as soon as possible.
The action plan consists of six workstreams: Change and release management, Business continuity management, Fail-over and recovery tests, Communication protocols, Governance, and Data centre and IT operations.

ECB takes next step in harmonising statistical reporting for euro area banks following consultation
Majority of banks believe benefits outweigh costs
Harmonised statistical reporting system to reduce banks’ reporting burden and improve policymakers’ analysis
The European Central Bank (ECB) is today taking the next step in the project to develop the Integrated Reporting Framework (IReF). This harmonised statistical reporting system is intended to make it easier for banks to report statistical data to the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and to reduce their reporting burden by leveraging digitalisation and state-of-the-art production organisation. At the same time, the system will facilitate policymakers’ analysis and comparison of such data.
Following an industry-wide consultation, the ECB is now launching the design phase of the project, which is expected to go live in 2027. This time frame will enable reporting agents and the ESCB to undertake the necessary technical work.
The IReF will ensure a common understanding of the statistical terms and standardise the information that banks are required to provide to their respective central banks. As part of the consultation, banks were asked to assess the costs and benefits of the system. Around two-thirds believed that the benefits would outweigh the costs.
One of the next steps in the project will be to draft an ECB regulation, which is expected to be adopted in 2024. In parallel, the ESCB will continue cooperating with the European Banking Authority, the European Commission and the Single Resolution Board to harmonise the reporting of all (statistical, prudential and resolution) data that banks have to provide to the European authorities.

The Governing Council judges that the progress on economic recovery and towards its medium-term inflation target permits a step-by-step reduction in the pace of its asset purchases over the coming quarters. But monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation to stabilise at the 2% inflation target over the medium term. In view of the current uncertainty, the Governing Council needs to maintain flexibility and optionality in the conduct of monetary policy. With this is mind, the Governing Council took the following decisions:
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
In the first quarter of 2022, the Governing Council expects to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP at a lower pace than in the previous quarter. It will discontinue net asset purchases under the PEPP at the end of March 2022.
The Governing Council decided to extend the reinvestment horizon for the PEPP. It now intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made efforts to achieve the Governing Council’s goal more effective. Within our mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability. In particular, in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout of the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
In line with a step-by-step reduction in asset purchases and to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with inflation stabilising at its target over the medium term, the Governing Council decided on a monthly net purchase pace of €40 billion in the second quarter and €30 billion in the third quarter under the APP. From October 2022 onwards, the Governing Council will maintain net asset purchases under the APP at a monthly pace of €20 billion for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates. The Governing Council expects net purchases to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric 2% inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching 2% well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at 2% over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced, it expects the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III to end in June next year. The Governing Council will also assess the appropriate calibration of its two-tier system for reserve remuneration so that the negative interest rate policy does not limit banks’ intermediation capacity in an environment of ample excess liquidity.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate and in either direction, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

ECB expects to select new euro banknote designs by 2024
ECB to seek the opinion of the public
Multidisciplinary group to advise Governing Council on new themes
[The Members of the Theme Advisory Group list was updated at 16:00 on 7 January 2022 to include the name of the Maltese representative, and at 16:00 on 8 March 2022 to include the name of the new Estonian representative replacing Vladimir Taiger.]
The European Central Bank (ECB) plans to redesign euro banknotes, working with European citizens in a process that is expected to lead to a final decision in 2024.
The redesign process will start with the creation of focus groups, tasked with gathering opinions from people across the euro area on possible themes for the future euro banknotes. A theme advisory group with one expert from each euro area country will then submit a shortlist of new themes to the ECB’s Governing Council. The members of the advisory group have already been appointed by the ECB based on proposals from euro area national central banks, and are drawn from diverse fields such as history, natural and social sciences, the visual arts and technology. Current euro banknote designs are based on an “ages and styles” theme, represented by windows, doorways and bridges.
“Euro banknotes are here to stay. They are a tangible and visible symbol that we stand together in Europe, particularly in times of crisis, and there is still a strong demand for them,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “After 20 years, it’s time to review the look of our banknotes to make them more relatable to Europeans of all ages and backgrounds.”
Following the proposals from the advisory group, the ECB will call on the public for their input on the shortlisted themes. A design competition for the new banknotes will follow, after which the ECB will again consult the public. The Governing Council will take the final decision.
The launch of this process follows a commitment by the ECB’s Governing Council to ensure innovative and secure banknotes that connect with Europeans. The latest Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area (SPACE) showed that cash remained the most popular means of payment for in-person retail payments in 2019. Despite the increase in cashless payments during the pandemic, the demand for cash has risen owing to cash’s crucial role as a store of value. As part of its Cash 2030 strategy, the Eurosystem is taking concrete steps to guarantee that cash continues to be available and accepted as a means of payment well into the future – including following the possible launch of a digital euro.
“We want to develop euro banknotes that European citizens can identify with and will be proud to use as their money,” said ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “The process to redesign the euro banknotes will run in parallel with our investigation on a digital euro. Both projects aim to fulfil our mandate of providing safe and secure money to Europeans.”
After completing the design process, the Governing Council will authorise the production of new banknotes and decide on potential issuance dates.

Improvement in availability of external finance and banks’ willingness to provide credit
Increase in turnover but also higher production costs, particularly for materials and energy
Macroeconomic environment no longer perceived by firms as an impediment to accessing external finance
For the period from April to September 2021, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the euro area reported an increase in turnover in net terms, reflecting the rebound in economic activity since the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic (Chart 1).
[
1
]
On balance, they nonetheless continued to report lower profits as a result of increases in other costs (materials and energy) and labour costs. In net terms, 71% of euro area SMEs reported a rise in the cost of materials and energy, which is the highest percentage since the start of the survey in 2009. At the same time, 43% indicated that labour costs had gone up, which is still a smaller percentage than in the period just before the pandemic. In this survey round, SMEs signalled a net increase (11%) in their fixed investment across all countries and size classes. In the coming months, they expect the economic recovery to continue. In net terms, 36% foresee an increase in turnover over the next six months, which is a higher percentage than in the last survey round.
As in the past, the main concern for SMEs in terms of their business activity was the difficulty in finding skilled labour, followed by the difficulty in finding customers. Concerns about access to finance declined further in the euro area as a whole (7%), with SMEs signalling further improvements in the availability of bank loans. SMEs’ external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the availability of external financing – fell into negative territory, as it was before the pandemic, both for the euro area as a whole (-2%, down from 4%) and for most euro area countries. The percentage of SMEs expecting an improvement in the availability of most external financing sources in the coming months was similar to that in 2019.
In this survey round, a larger net percentage of SMEs perceived an improvement in banks’ willingness to provide credit (11%). The improvements were reported across most countries and all size classes. In addition, euro area SMEs no longer perceived the general economic outlook as an impediment to their access to finance (0%) (Chart 2). Finally, they continued to see public financial support as a factor making a moderate contribution to their access to finance, with higher percentages among micro and small firms.
This report presents the main results of the 25th round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, which was conducted between 6 September and 15 October 2021 and covered the period from April to September 2021. The sample comprised 10,493 enterprises in the euro area, of which 9,554 (91%) were SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Framework assesses security and efficiency of electronic payments, including electronic wallets and crypto-asset-related services
ECB calls for swift progress on overseeing global digital payment solutions and stablecoins
Overseen companies to adhere to new principles within one year
The ECB’s Governing Council has approved a new oversight framework for electronic payments following a public consultation. The framework is designed to make the current and future payments ecosystem safer and more efficient, as part of the ECB’s statutory task to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.
The Eurosystem oversight framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA framework) includes an assessment methodology and an exemption policy. It replaces the current Eurosystem oversight approach for payment instruments and complements the Eurosystem’s oversight of payment systems. The Eurosystem will use the new framework to oversee companies enabling or supporting the use of payment cards, credit transfers, direct debits, e-money transfers and digital payment tokens, including electronic wallets. The PISA framework will also cover crypto-asset-related services, such as the acceptance of crypto-assets by merchants within a card payment scheme and the option to send, receive or pay with crypto-assets via an electronic wallet.
“The retail payments ecosystem is evolving fast owing to innovation and technological change. This calls for a forward-looking approach in overseeing digital payment solutions,” said ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “The PISA framework will include digital payment tokens such as stablecoins, alongside traditional payment instruments and schemes we have gained experience in over the years. Internationally coordinated action will also have to be stepped up to cope with the challenges posed by global digital payment solutions and stablecoins.”
The PISA framework complements forthcoming EU regulations on crypto-assets (including stablecoins) and international standards for global stablecoins. The Eurosystem also aims to cooperate with other authorities.
Companies that are already subject to Eurosystem oversight are expected to adhere to the principles of the new framework by 15 November 2022. Other companies will have a grace period of one year from the moment they are notified that they will be subject to oversight under the new framework. All overseen companies will be invited to submit self-assessments and supporting documentation, which will form the basis of a continuous dialogue between them and the overseer.

Near-term pandemic-related risks to financial stability have declined as economy rebounds
Growing vulnerabilities in housing markets and stretched financial asset valuations
Potential challenges to recovery and inflation outlook from strains in global supply chains and rising energy prices
The economic recovery in the euro area has reduced near-term pandemic-related risks to financial stability, the November 2021 Financial Stability Review (FSR) published today by the European Central Bank (ECB) concludes. However, vulnerabilities are rising due to stretched valuations in some asset markets, elevated levels of public and private debt, and increased risk-taking by non-banks.
“Risks of high rates of corporate defaults and bank losses are now significantly lower than six months ago. But risks from the pandemic have not disappeared entirely,” said Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB.
Euro area firms saw their profits recover as the economy rebounded in the first half of 2021. Partly thanks to this, corporate insolvencies remained below pre-pandemic levels, although they did increase in the economic sectors that were most affected by the pandemic and could still rise further.
At the same time, strains in global supply chains and the recent rise in energy prices could pose challenges to the economic recovery and the outlook for inflation. The risk of price corrections has increased in some real estate and financial markets. Vulnerabilities in residential real estate markets have grown, especially in countries with valuations that were already elevated prior to the pandemic. Riskier segments of global financial markets have experienced increasing investor demand, with interest widening in novel asset classes such as crypto-assets.
Non-banks, which include investment funds, insurers and pension funds, continued to increase their exposure to lower-rated corporate debt and could face substantial credit losses if conditions in the corporate sector were to worsen. Investment funds also remain highly exposed to liquidity risk.
Market valuations of euro area banks have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Bank losses have remained low, although some pandemic-related losses may take time to materialise. Further ahead, low cost efficiency and overcapacity remain key structural challenges to the profitability of euro area banks.
Tighter macroprudential policies can help address growing vulnerabilities, notably for housing markets in some countries. It will also be essential to enhance the regulatory framework for the financial sector, including full, timely implementation of the Basel III reforms and a stronger policy framework for the non-bank financial sector.

2019 registered the second lowest card fraud share since 2007
80% of card fraud took place via online and mobile payments, while 15% took place in shops and 5% at ATMs
Cross-border transactions accounted for 65% of the total value of card fraud
In 2019 the total value of fraudulent transactions involving cards issued in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) (which is made up of the EU Member States, Switzerland, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) amounted to €1.87 billion out of a total value of all card transactions of €5.16 trillion. This means that 3.6 cents in every €100 spent using credit and debit cards were lost to fraud in 2019. This is the second lowest fraud share recorded since the start of data collection in 2007.
The Eurosystem’s seventh report on card fraud, which analyses statistical information on card payment transactions and fraud in the euro area, reveals that 80% of fraudulent card transactions in 2019 resulted from so-called card-not-present (CNP) payments, which are mainly carried out via online or mobile transactions. Compared with 2018, the value of CNP fraud increased by 4.3%. Fraudulent transactions at point-of-sale (POS) terminals and automated teller machines (ATMs) accounted for 15% and 5% respectively of the total value of card fraud in 2019.
Fraud committed at POS terminals was slightly higher, increasing by 2.2% in 2019, while fraud committed at ATMs decreased by 6.1%. The decline in fraud at ATMs was driven by a notable decline in fraudulent transactions involving counterfeit cards acquired outside SEPA, as the increasing global adoption of “chip and pin” technology (the EMV standard) has further reduced opportunities for committing fraud using cards with a counterfeit magnetic stripe.

The report also reveals that 65% of all fraudulent transactions conducted worldwide in 2019 using cards issued in SEPA involved cross-border payments (compared with 64% in 2018).
Looking ahead, the market-wide implementation of the Regulatory Technical Standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2)

could further reduce card fraud in Europe. Nevertheless, raising awareness and protecting secure communication between payment service providers and end-users remain key, as criminals continue to target card holders, especially in a world that increasingly relies on contactless and online payments in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
The Eurosystem will continue to monitor developments in payment fraud and the security of card payments and payment schemes, supported by the collection of detailed and comprehensive statistical information.

Overall credit terms and conditions tightened slightly for all counterparty types
While financing conditions in securities financing markets continued to ease for most collateral types, credit terms in OTC derivatives markets tightened
Overall credit terms and conditions tightened slightly in both securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets over the June 2021 to August 2021 review period. Survey respondents reported a tightening of overall credit terms for all counterparty types. Both price and non-price terms tightened somewhat for all counterparty types, and in particular for investment funds, hedge funds and insurance companies.
Respondents attributed the less favourable price terms mainly to a general deterioration in market liquidity and functioning, a decreased willingness of institutions to take on risk, and internal treasury charges for funding. They attributed the less favourable non-price terms mainly to a decreased willingness of institutions to take on risk, greater competition from other institutions, a general deterioration in market liquidity and functioning, and a reduced availability of balance sheet or capital.
With regard to securities financing transactions, respondents reported an ongoing easing of credit terms in securities financing markets across most collateral types, with increased maximum amounts of funding, increased maximum maturity of funding, decreased haircuts to collateral and, most notably, a continued decrease in financing rates/spreads for funding against almost all collateral types. Demand continued to weaken for funding against almost all collateral types, but in particular against government bonds and asset-backet securities.
With regard to non-centrally cleared derivatives markets, respondents reported increased initial margin requirements for OTC derivatives, while liquidity and trading was broadly unchanged for the most part. Valuation disputes showed a moderate increase in volume as well as in duration and persistence.
The September 2021 survey included special questions aimed at determining the main purposes for which counterparties use OTC derivatives and securities financing transactions. Counterparties use OTC derivatives for a variety of purposes, depending on counterparty type, but they use securities financing transactions mainly for yield enhancement. While non-financial corporations, sovereigns, and bank and dealers use OTC derivatives almost exclusively for hedging purposes, hedge funds use them predominantly for speculation.
For counterparties that use OTC derivatives for yield enhancement and/or speculation, interest rate derivatives are the instrument of choice, while for counterparties that use securities financing transactions for yield enhancement and/or speculation, high-quality government, sub-national and supra-national bonds are preferred.
The September 2021 SESFOD, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The September 2021 survey collected qualitative information on changes between June 2021 and August 2021. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

HICP inflation expectations revised up for all horizons
Real GDP growth expectations largely unchanged
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the fourth quarter of 2021, HICP inflation expectations stood at 2.3%, 1.9% and 1.7% for 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Compared with the previous round for the third quarter of 2021, these were revised upward by 0.4 percentage points for 2021 and 2022 and by 0.2 percentage points for 2023. Respondents attributed the upward revisions mainly to higher energy prices and the impact of supply chain tensions. Regarding the near-term outlook, many respondents reported that they expected a further increase in the inflation rate in the final months of 2021 but continue to expect a sharp fall in inflation to below 2% during the course of 2022. Regarding the broader factors influencing the inflation outlook, respondents, on average, believed that underlying inflation pressure would gradually rise in line with the recovery in economic activity. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 1.9%, revised up from 1.8% in the previous round.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents’ expectations were largely unchanged for 2021-2023. The apparent upward revision for 2021 mainly reflects the actual growth outcome in the second quarter, which was stronger than previously expected. Overall, the growth expectations continue to imply that economic activity will surpass its pre-pandemic level (fourth quarter of 2019) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were revised up slightly to 1.5% from 1.4% in the previous round.
The profile of unemployment has been revised down by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points for all horizons. SPF respondents expect the unemployment rate to decline from 7.8% in 2021 to 7.0% by 2026."

The Governing Council continues to judge that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the second and third quarters of this year.
The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations. Specifically:
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Net purchases under the APP will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.
The Governing Council continues to judge that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP than in the second and third quarters of this year.
The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.
The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards remained broadly unchanged for firms and tightened for housing loans
Loan demand by firms and households continued to increase
ECB’s monetary policy measures continue to support lending conditions and volumes
According to the October 2021 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – for loans or credit lines to enterprises remained broadly unchanged (net percentage of banks standing at 1%, see Chart 1) in the third quarter of 2021. Regarding loans to households for house purchase, euro area banks reported a net tightening of credit standards (net percentage of 8%), while credit standards for consumer credit and other lending to households also remained broadly unchanged (net percentage of -1%). Banks referred to risk perceptions related to the improved economic outlook as having a net easing impact on credit standards for loans to firms and households. Banks’ risk tolerance and their cost of funds and balance sheet situation had a neutral impact for loans to firms and consumer credit, while banks reported a net tightening impact of these factors for housing loans. In the fourth quarter of 2021, banks expect credit standards to tighten for loans to firms and housing loans, and to ease slightly for consumer credit.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –eased slightly, on balance, for loans to firms, while they tightened for housing loans and remained broadly unchanged for consumer credit in the third quarter of 2021. For margins on average loans, banks continued to report a narrowing in net terms across loan categories. Margins on riskier loans also narrowed for housing loans but widened for firms and remained unchanged for consumer credit.
Banks reported, on balance, a slight increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the third quarter of 2021 (see Chart 2). Financing needs for fixed investment contributed positively to loan demand for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, loan demand was supported by firms’ financing needs for inventories and working capital, mergers and acquisitions and debt refinancing and restructuring, as well as the low general level of interest rates. At the same time, banks reported on balance that firms’ access to internal and alternative external financing sources had a negative impact on loan demand. Demand for housing loans and for consumer credit and other lending to households increased in net terms in the third quarter of 2021, supported by improved consumer confidence and the low general level of interest rates. In addition, housing market prospects contributed positively to demand for housing loans and increased spending on durables contributed positively to demand for consumer credit. In the fourth quarter of 2021, banks expect net demand to increase further for loans to firms and households.
Euro area banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding continued to improve in the third quarter of 2021, according to the banks surveyed. In addition, banks reported that the ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP), the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) continued to have a positive impact on their liquidity positions and market financing conditions. At the same time, banks indicated that the ECB’s asset purchases and the negative deposit facility rate (DFR) had a negative impact on their profitability, mainly owing to their impact on net interest income. However, this was mitigated by the ECB’s two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings and the TLTRO III programme. Asset purchases and the negative DFR had a net easing impact on lending conditions and a positive impact on lending volumes, mainly for loans to firms. Finally, banks reported that TLTRO III had a net easing impact on terms and conditions and a positive impact on lending volumes across all loan categories.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the October 2021 survey relate to changes observed in the third quarter of 2021 and expected changes in the fourth quarter of 2021, unless otherwise indicated. The October 2021 survey round was conducted between 20 September and 5 October 2021. A total of 146 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

ECB appoints 30 senior business professionals with proven experience
Members to advise Eurosystem on design and distribution of potential digital euro
Meetings of group to be held at least quarterly, starting in November 2021
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today announced the members of the Market Advisory Group for the digital euro project.
The Eurosystem’s High-Level Task Force on Central Bank Digital Currency called for expressions of interest on 14 July, following the Governing Council’s approval of the digital euro project investigation phase. After assessing applications, the selection committee appointed 30 senior business professionals with proven experience and a broad understanding of the euro area retail payments market.
“I am pleased that many high-quality experts from the private sector are willing to contribute to the digital euro project”, says ECB Board Member Fabio Panetta, Chair of the High-Level Task Force. “Their expertise will facilitate the integration of prospective users’ and distributors’ views on a digital euro during the investigation phase.”
Members of the Market Advisory Group will act in a personal capacity, advising the Eurosystem on the design and distribution of a potential digital euro from an industry perspective, and on how a digital euro could add value for all players in the euro area’s diverse payments ecosystem. A representative from the European Commission and representatives from Eurosystem national central banks will also participate in the group.
Meetings are to be held at least quarterly, starting in November 2021, and written consultations will be organised between meetings. The issues identified will also be considered in the Eurosystem’s established forum for institutional dialogue on retail payments, the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB). The ERPB consists of high-level representatives of industry associations and represents a wide range of stakeholders. In addition, the Eurosystem will engage with the public and merchants through dedicated surveys (e.g. of focus groups) and will continue to hold technical workshops with the industry.

I respect Jens Weidmann’s decision to step down from his position as President of Deutsche Bundesbank at the end of this year after more than 10 years of service, but I also immensely regret it. Jens is a good personal friend on whose loyalty I could always count.
As the Governing Council’s longest serving member he had unparalleled experience that he was always ready to share. In the past two years we built a very strong and productive relationship based on our joint commitment to furthering European unity, fulfilling the ECB’s price stability mandate, helping the euro area economy through the unprecedented crisis caused by the coronavirus, and stabilising the global economy shaken by the effects of the pandemic.
While Jens had clear views on monetary policy I was always impressed by his search for common ground in the Governing Council, by his empathy for his Eurosystem colleagues, and his willingness to find a compromise. One of the many moments this became evident was in our work on the strategy review where he significantly contributed to its successful, unanimous agreement in the Governing Council.
I will miss Jens and his always constructive and good-humoured approach in all of our discussions."

Firms and banks to be severely affected if climate change issues not addressed
Orderly and swift transition to minimise costs and maximise benefits outweighs short-term cost of transition to zero-carbon economy over medium to longer term
Investment in sectors and regions heavily exposed to climate risk set to suffer most
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published the results of its economy-wide climate stress test. The exercise tested the impact of climate change on more than four million firms worldwide and 1,600 euro area banks under three different climate policy scenarios.
The results show that firms and banks clearly benefit from adopting green policies early on to foster the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The exercise also reveals that the impact of climate risk is concentrated in certain regions and sectors of the euro area. In particular, firms located in regions most exposed to physical risk could face very severe and frequent natural disasters, which would in turn affect their creditworthiness.
Climate risk includes both physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the economic impact of an expected increase in the frequency and magnitude of natural disasters. In Europe, physical risks are unevenly distributed, with northern regions being more prone to floods and southern regions more exposed to heat stress and wildfires. Transition risk is the cost of introducing policies to reduce CO2 emissions, particularly for certain high-emitting industries. For example, carbon-intense industries, such as mining or electricity, would incur considerable costs to reduce CO2 emissions, which would increase their probability of default over the short to medium term.
That said, the transition to a greener economy is also a golden opportunity. The exercise shows that the advantages of taking action early on outweigh the initial costs over the medium to longer term, also as a result of energy efficiency gains for firms and cheaper energy prices overall.
“Without policies to transition to a greener economy, physical risks will increase over time. They will increase non-linearly, and due to the irreversible nature of climate change, this increase will continue over time. It is essential to transition early on and gradually, so that we can mitigate the cost of both the green transition and the future impact of natural disasters”, said Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB.
Euro area banks could be severely affected under a scenario where climate change is not addressed. The expected losses on corporate loan portfolios are shown to rise significantly over time, driven by ever increasing physical risk, with the potential of becoming critical over the next 30 years. In 2050, the average corporate loan portfolio of a euro area bank is 8% more likely to default under the hot house world scenario than under an orderly transition. When distinguishing between different loan portfolios, the climate-induced impact becomes even more pronounced, and particularly over time. Portfolios most vulnerable to climate risk are 30% more likely to default in 2050 compared with 2020 under the hot house world scenario: this increase is five times larger than the average increase under the same scenario.
The final climate stress test results are in line with the preliminary results published in March 2021 and complement these findings by including assessments of banks’ resilience to climate risks through loans, security and equity holdings.
The ECB’s economy-wide climate stress test marks the first step in the ECB’s climate roadmap. The results and methodology will inform the 2022 supervisory climate stress test for the banks that the ECB directly supervises. They will also feature in the climate stress test of the Eurosystem balance sheet, which is being planned for the first quarter of 2022.

Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judges that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) than in the previous two quarters.
The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its forward guidance on their likely future evolution, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations. Specifically:
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.

This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Net purchases under the APP will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.
Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judges that favourable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP than in the previous two quarters.

Review launched in late 2020 after incidents affecting TARGET Services
Deloitte makes 18 recommendations
Eurosystem will implement recommended measures
The European Central Bank (ECB) has today published the report that presents the results of Deloitte’s independent review of incidents that affected TARGET2 and TARGET2 Securities in 2020.
The Eurosystem’s response accepts Deloitte’s general conclusions and recommendations made in the review and commits to implement them.
The ECB announced the launch of an independent review in November 2020 after an incident, which affected TARGET2 on 23 October 2020, caused an extended outage. In total, five major information technology (not cyber) related incidents occurred in 2020, affecting payment transactions and securities processing of the TARGET Services that are under the responsibility of the Eurosystem and operated by four service-providing national central banks (Deutsche Bundesbank, Banco de España, Banque de France and Banca d’Italia).
The independent review describes the incidents in detail, outlines their consequences for TARGET Services participants and identifies their root causes. It lists weaknesses in several areas, including business continuity management, fail-over and recovery testing, and communication protocols in crisis situations. Based on these findings, the review issues 18 detailed recommendations.
Measures addressing several recommendations have already been agreed or implemented. For example, in 2020 the Eurosystem decided to establish a more comprehensive second line of defence for all the TARGET Services, which has already been partially implemented, and which will be fully operational by the end of 2021. The Eurosystem has also improved its external communication with market participants after dedicated industry workshops that were held in the first quarter of 2021.
The Eurosystem is committed to decisively implement the other recommendations as soon as possible, as also stated in its response. Market participants will be kept informed about the deployment of the measures.

ECB publishes indicative tender calendar for 2022
ECB publishes indicative reserve maintenance period calendar for 2022
The European Central Bank (ECB) today published the indicative calendars for the Eurosystem’s regular tender operations and reserve maintenance periods in 2022.
The indicative calendar for the Eurosystem’s regular tender operations includes only main refinancing operations (MROs) and three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). It does not include any supplementary or ad hoc operations which may be carried out in 2022. The calendar can be downloaded from the ECB’s website.
The indicative calendar for the Eurosystem’s reserve maintenance periods takes into account the calendar for Governing Council meetings in 2022, as well as the calendar for regular tender operations.
Indicative calendar for reserve maintenance periods in 2022 (including maintenance period 8 of 2021):"

HICP inflation expectations revised up for all horizons
Real GDP growth expectations revised upwards for shorter and medium-term horizons
Unemployment rate expectations revised down for all horizons
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the third quarter of 2021, HICP inflation expectations stood at 1.9%, 1.5% and 1.5% for 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Compared with the previous round for the second quarter of 2021, these were revised upward by 0.3 percentage points for 2021, 0.2 percentage points for 2022 and 0.05 percentage points for 2023 (unchanged rounded to the first decimal point). Respondents once again confirmed that they considered some of the factors behind the expected increase in inflation in 2021 to be temporary but believed that underlying inflation pressure would gradually rise as economic activity recovers. Longer-term inflation expectations for 2026 stood at 1.8%, revised up from 1.7% for 2025 in the previous round.
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents revised up their expectations for 2021-2023. These expectations imply that economic activity will surpass its pre-pandemic level (fourth quarter of 2019) in the fourth quarter of 2021, one quarter earlier than previously expected. Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were unchanged at 1.4%.
The profile of unemployment has been revised down for all horizons.
Indicators of the uncertainty surrounding expectations for the main macroeconomic variables mostly eased further but remained relatively elevated by historical standards."

In its recent strategy review, the Governing Council agreed a symmetric inflation target of two per cent over the medium term. The key ECB interest rates have been close to their lower bound for some time and the medium-term outlook for inflation is still well below the Governing Council’s target. In these conditions, the Governing Council today revised its forward guidance on interest rates. It did so to underline its commitment to maintain a persistently accommodative monetary policy stance to meet its inflation target.
In support of its symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Having confirmed its June assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council continues to expect purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) over the current quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.
The Governing Council also confirmed its other measures to support its price stability mandate, namely the level of the key ECB interest rates, its purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), its reinvestment policies and its longer-term refinancing operations. Specifically:
Key ECB interest rates
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.
In support of its symmetric two per cent inflation target and in line with its monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it sees inflation reaching two per cent well ahead of the end of its projection horizon and durably for the rest of the projection horizon, and it judges that realised progress in underlying inflation is sufficiently advanced to be consistent with inflation stabilising at two per cent over the medium term. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
Asset purchase programme (APP)
Net purchases under the APP will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)
The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over.
As the incoming information confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the June monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council continues to expect purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.
The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.
The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Refinancing operations
The Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.
***
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its two per cent target over the medium term.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards broadly unchanged following significant net tightening in 2020
Loan demand by firms supported by fixed investment
Bank lending conditions reflect continued support by monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities
According to the July 2021 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – remained broadly unchanged for loans or credit lines to enterprises (net percentage of banks standing at -1%, see Chart 1) in the second quarter of 2021. Credit standards were also broadly unchanged in net terms for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of -1%) and for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 0%). These developments follow the significant net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms and households observed in 2020 and the moderate net tightening observed for firms in the first quarter of 2021. They reflect the overall improvement in the euro area economy as containment measures are lifted and the continued support provided by monetary, fiscal and supervisory authorities. The previous significant net tightening implied mainly by risk perceptions related to higher credit risks became smaller across loan categories: for loans to firms there was no further change to risk perceptions, while the previous net tightening of risk perceptions turned into a small net easing for housing loans. Competition from other banks also exerted a limited net easing impact on credit standards. Banks’ cost of funds and balance sheet situation mostly had a neutral impact on credit standards, reflecting banks’ solid capital ratios and favourable funding costs. In the third quarter of 2021, banks expect credit standards to tighten slightly for loans to firms and to remain broadly unchanged for households.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts – eased, on balance, for loans to firms and households in the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly on account of narrower margins for average loans. Meanwhile, banks reported broadly unchanged or wider margins for riskier loans in net terms.
Banks reported, on balance, a moderate increase in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the second quarter of 2021 (see Chart 2). For the first time since the third quarter of 2019, firms’ financing needs for fixed investment contributed positively to loan demand, suggesting that firms may become less reluctant to invest. By contrast, their financing needs for working capital remained unchanged owing to firms’ available liquidity buffers and the likely recovery in revenues given the improving economic situation. Banks reported a strong net increase in demand for housing loans in the second quarter of 2021. Higher consumer confidence, favourable housing market prospects and the low general level of interest rates all contributed to the net increase in demand. For consumer credit and other lending to households, loan demand also increased in net terms, largely driven by higher consumer confidence and spending on durables. In the third quarter of 2021, banks expect net demand to increase further for loans to firms and households.
Euro area banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding continued to improve in the second quarter of 2021, according to the banks surveyed. Banks also reported that non-performing loan (NPL) ratios had a moderate net tightening impact on their credit standards for loans to enterprises and a broadly neutral impact on credit standards for loans to households in the first half of 2021. In addition, banks indicated a moderate net tightening of credit standards for loans to firms across the main economic sectors in the first half of 2021, reflecting both the moderate net tightening of credit standards for loans to all firms in the first quarter and the broadly unchanged credit standards in the second quarter. Euro area banks also indicated a net increase in demand for loans or credit lines for most economic sectors. Finally, euro area banks reported that government guarantees related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) continued to support banks’ lending conditions for loans to firms, while demand for loans with guarantees declined in net terms in the first half of 2021.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the July 2021 survey relate to changes observed in the second quarter of 2021 and expected changes in the third quarter of 2021, unless otherwise indicated. The July 2021 survey round was conducted between 14 and 29 June 2021. A total of 142 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Investigation phase of digital euro project to last 24 months
Design to be based on users’ preferences and technical advice by merchants and intermediaries
No technical obstacles identified during preliminary experimentation phase
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided today to launch the investigation phase of a digital euro project. Following the decision, the President of the Eurogroup Paschal Donohoe joined the meeting, congratulated the Governing Council and expressed his full support for the project.
“It has been nine months since we published our report on a digital euro. In that time, we have carried out further analysis, sought input from citizens and professionals, and conducted some experiments, with encouraging results. All of this has led us to decide to move up a gear and start the digital euro project”, says ECB President Christine Lagarde. “Our work aims to ensure that in the digital age citizens and firms continue to have access to the safest form of money, central bank money”.
The investigation phase will last 24 months and aim to address key issues regarding design and distribution. A digital euro must be able to meet the needs of Europeans while at the same time helping to prevent illicit activities and avoiding any undesirable impact on financial stability and monetary policy. This will not prejudge any future decision on the possible issuance of a digital euro, which will come only later. In any event, a digital euro would complement cash, not replace it.
“We will engage with the European Parliament and other European decision-makers and inform them regularly about our findings. Citizens, merchants and the payments industry will also be involved”, says ECB Board Member Fabio Panetta, Chair of the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro.
During the project’s investigation phase, the Eurosystem will focus on a possible functional design that is based on users’ needs. It will involve focus groups, prototyping and conceptual work. The investigation phase will examine the use cases that a digital euro should provide as a matter of priority to meet its objectives: a riskless, accessible, and efficient form of digital central bank money.
The project will also shed light on the changes to the EU legislative framework which might be needed and that will be discussed with, and decided by, European co-legislators. The ECB will continue to engage with the European Parliament and other European policymakers throughout the project’s investigation phase. The technical work on the digital euro with the European Commission will also be intensified.
Finally, the investigation phase will assess the possible impact of a digital euro on the market, identifying the design options to ensure privacy and avoid risks for euro area citizens, intermediaries and the overall economy. It will also define a business model for supervised intermediaries within the digital euro ecosystem. A market advisory group will take account of prospective users’ and distributors’ views of a digital euro during the investigation phase. Those views will also be discussed by the Euro Retail Payments Board.
The investigation phase will benefit from the experimentation work done by the ECB and the euro area national central banks over the past nine months, which has involved participants from academia and the private sector.
Experiments were conducted in the four following areas: the digital euro ledger; privacy and anti-money laundering; limits on digital euro in circulation; end-user access while not connected to the internet and facilitating inclusiveness with appropriate devices. No major technical obstacles were identified to any of the assessed design options.
Both the Eurosystem TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) and alternatives such as blockchain were proven capable of processing more than 40,000 transactions per second. The experiments also suggested that architectures combining centralised and decentralised elements are possible.
According to these experiments, a digital euro core infrastructure would be environmentally friendly: for the architectures that were tested, the power used to run tens of thousands of transactions per second is negligible compared with the energy consumption of crypto-assets such as bitcoin.
These practical findings will provide useful input for the investigation phase.

Overall credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets tightened slightly for each counterparty type except banks/dealers, hedge funds and sovereigns
Financing conditions for various collateral types eased significantly, while demand for funding across almost all collateral types continued to weaken further
Initial margin requirements increased for all OTC derivatives, while liquidity and trading was broadly unchanged
Overall credit terms and conditions in euro-denominated securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets tightened slightly over the March 2021 to May 2021 review period. Survey respondents reported a tightening of overall credit terms for each individual counterparty type except banks/dealers, hedge funds and sovereigns, for which overall credit terms remained unchanged.
Respondents mainly attributed the less favourable price terms to a general deterioration in market liquidity and functioning, a decreased willingness of institutions to take on risk and internal treasury charges for funding.
Respondents expected overall terms to tighten somewhat further over the June 2021 to August 2021 review period.
At the same time respondents reported significant easing of financing conditions for various collateral types, with increased maximum amounts of funding, increased maximum maturity of funding, decreased haircuts to collateral and, most notably, a continued decrease in financing rates/spreads for funding of nearly all collateral types.
Against the background of deteriorating liquidity for most collateral types, demand for funding of almost all collateral types continued to weaken further.
With regard to credit terms and conditions for various types of non-centrally cleared derivatives, respondents reported increased initial margin requirements for all OTC derivatives, while liquidity and trading was broadly unchanged for the most part. Valuation disputes remained broadly unchanged in volume while increasing in duration and persistence overall.
The June 2021 SESFOD, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The June 2021 survey collected qualitative information on changes between March 2021 and May 2021. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

The ECB’s Governing Council is strongly committed:
to further incorporating climate change considerations into its monetary policy framework;
to expanding its analytical capacity in macroeconomic modelling, statistics and monetary policy with regard to climate change;
to including climate change considerations in monetary policy operations in the areas of disclosure, risk assessment, collateral framework and corporate sector asset purchases;
to implementing the action plan in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting.
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided on a comprehensive action plan, with an ambitious roadmap (see annex) to further incorporate climate change considerations into its policy framework. With this decision, the Governing Council underlines its commitment to more systematically reflect environmental sustainability considerations in its monetary policy. The decision follows the conclusion of the strategy review of 2020-21, in which the reflections on climate change and environmental sustainability were of central importance.
Addressing climate change is a global challenge and a policy priority for the European Union. While governments and parliaments have the primary responsibility to act on climate change, within its mandate, the ECB recognises the need to further incorporate climate considerations into its policy framework. Climate change and the transition towards a more sustainable economy affect the outlook for price stability through their impact on macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, output, employment, interest rates, investment and productivity; financial stability; and the transmission of monetary policy. Moreover, climate change and the carbon transition affect the value and the risk profile of the assets held on the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, potentially leading to an undesirable accumulation of climate-related financial risks.
With this action plan, the ECB will increase its contribution to addressing climate change, in line with its obligations under the EU Treaties. The action plan comprises measures that strengthen and broaden ongoing initiatives by the Eurosystem to better account for climate change considerations with the aim of preparing the ground for changes to the monetary policy implementation framework. The design of these measures will be consistent with the price stability objective and should take into account the implications of climate change for an efficient allocation of resources. The recently established ECB climate change centre will coordinate the relevant activities within the ECB, in close cooperation with the Eurosystem. These activities will focus on the following areas:
Macroeconomic modelling and assessment of implications for monetary policy transmission. The ECB will accelerate the development of new models and will conduct theoretical and empirical analyses to monitor the implications of climate change and related policies for the economy, the financial system and the transmission of monetary policy through financial markets and the banking system to households and firms.
Statistical data for climate change risk analyses. The ECB will develop new experimental indicators, covering relevant green financial instruments and the carbon footprint of financial institutions, as well as their exposures to climate-related physical risks. This will be followed by step-by-step enhancements of such indicators, starting in 2022, also in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting.
Disclosures as a requirement for eligibility as collateral and asset purchases. The ECB will introduce disclosure requirements for private sector assets as a new eligibility criterion or as a basis for a differentiated treatment for collateral and asset purchases. Such requirements will take into account EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting and will promote more consistent disclosure practices in the market, while maintaining proportionality through adjusted requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises. The ECB will announce a detailed plan in 2022.
Enhancement of risk assessment capabilities. The ECB will start conducting climate stress tests of the Eurosystem balance sheet in 2022 to assess the Eurosystem’s risk exposure to climate change, leveraging on the methodology of the ECB’s economy-wide climate stress test. Furthermore, the ECB will assess whether the credit rating agencies accepted by the Eurosystem Credit Assessment Framework have disclosed the necessary information to understand how they incorporate climate change risks into their credit ratings. In addition, the ECB will consider developing minimum standards for the incorporation of climate change risks into its internal ratings.
Collateral framework. The ECB will consider relevant climate change risks when reviewing the valuation and risk control frameworks for assets mobilised as collateral by counterparties for Eurosystem credit operations. This will ensure that they reflect all relevant risks, including those arising from climate change. In addition, the ECB will continue to monitor structural market developments in sustainability products and stands ready to support innovation in the area of sustainable finance within the scope of its mandate, as exemplified by its decision to accept sustainability-linked bonds as collateral (see press release of 22 September 2020).
Corporate sector asset purchases. The ECB has already started to take relevant climate change risks into account in its due diligence procedures for its corporate sector asset purchases in its monetary policy portfolios. Looking ahead, the ECB will adjust the framework guiding the allocation of corporate bond purchases to incorporate climate change criteria, in line with its mandate. These will include the alignment of issuers with, at a minimum, EU legislation implementing the Paris agreement through climate change-related metrics or commitments of the issuers to such goals. Furthermore, the ECB will start disclosing climate-related information of the corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP) by the first quarter of 2023 (complementing the disclosures on the non-monetary policy portfolios; see press release of 4 February 2021).
The implementation of the action plan will be in line with progress on the EU policies and initiatives in the field of environmental sustainability disclosure and reporting, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the Taxonomy Regulation and the Regulation on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector.

New strategy adopts symmetric 2% inflation target over medium term
Governing Council confirms that HICP remains appropriate price measure and recommends inclusion of owner-occupied housing over time
New monetary policy strategy is result of thorough review launched in January 2020
Governing Council approves ambitious climate change action plan
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has today published its new monetary policy strategy, which it has set out in a monetary policy strategy statement.
The Governing Council considers that price stability is best maintained by aiming for a 2% inflation target over the medium term. This target is symmetric, meaning negative and positive deviations of inflation from the target are equally undesirable. When the economy is operating close to the lower bound on nominal interest rates, it requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy action to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched. This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target.
The Governing Council also confirmed that the set of ECB interest rates remains the primary monetary policy instrument. Other instruments, such as forward guidance, asset purchases and longer-term refinancing operations, that over the past decade have helped mitigate the limitations generated by the lower bound on nominal interest rates will remain an integral part of the ECB’s toolkit, to be used as appropriate.
“I am happy to announce that the Governing Council yesterday approved the ECB’s new monetary policy strategy. While taking the ECB’s primary mandate of price stability as a given, the review has allowed us to challenge our thinking, engage with numerous stakeholders, reflect, discuss and reach common ground on how to adapt our strategy. The new strategy is a strong foundation that will guide us in the conduct of monetary policy in the years to come,” said Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB.
The Governing Council confirmed that the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) remains the appropriate measure for assessing price stability. However, it recognises that the inclusion of the costs related to owner-occupied housing in the HICP would better represent the inflation relevant for households and that the inclusion of owner-occupied housing in the HICP is a multi-year project. So in the meantime, the Governing Council in its monetary policy assessments will take into account inflation measures that include initial estimates of the cost of owner-occupied housing to supplement its set of broader inflation measures.
The Governing Council acknowledged that climate change has profound implications for price stability and, accordingly, it has committed to an ambitious climate-related action plan. A dedicated press release has been published today.
The first regular monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council applying the new strategy will be held on 22 July 2021. The Governing Council intends to assess periodically the appropriateness of its monetary policy strategy, with the next assessment expected in 2025.
For media queries, please contact Peter Ehrlich, tel.: +49 69 1344 8320.
Notes
The Governing Council conducted a previous strategy review in 2003.
The new strategy that is being announced today follows a thorough review, which was launched on 23 January 2020. Over the last 18 months, the Governing Council has held numerous seminars, presentations, discussions and meetings dedicated to all elements of the review, under the overarching idea of leaving no stone unturned.
The current review has drawn on an immense collective effort by staff at the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area, organised in 13 separate work streams.
In the framework of the review, the ECB and the national central banks also hosted numerous listening activities with the general public, civil society organisations and academia. Ideas and perspectives shared at these events have fed into the Governing Council’s deliberations."

Financial stability vulnerabilities from climate change concentrated in certain regions, sectors and firms, with evolution of risks conditional on effective and timely transition to low carbon economy
Granular exposure mapping of climate hazards to financial risk reveals vulnerability to river flooding widespread across countries, compounded by wildfire, heat and water stress risk in some regions
Transition risk resulting from financial market repricing has cross-sector impact and varies within sectors owing to differences in emissions efficiency
Long-term scenario analyses suggest timely and orderly macroeconomic policies to tackle climate-related risk can reduce financial stability risks, notably for highest greenhouse-gas emitting sectors
The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report that takes a closer look at how a broadened set of climate change drivers affects millions of global firms and thousands of financial firms in the European Union (EU). It maps out prospective financial stability risks and contributes by further developing the analytical basis for more targeted and effective policy action.
The report tackles measurement gaps and, building on previous work in this field, establishes a detailed topology of physical and transition risks arising from climate change across regions, sectors and firms. It also applies a scenario analysis with long-dated financial risk horizons to capture prospective financial losses resulting from the timeliness and effectiveness of climate policies and technologies.
“These findings underline the crucial and urgent need for climate policies and economic transitions, not only to ensure that the targets of the Paris Agreement are met, but also to limit the long-run disruption to our economies, businesses and livelihoods,” said Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB and ESRB Chair.
The report’s granular mapping of financial exposures to climate change drivers finds three forms of risk concentration. First, exposures to physical climate hazards are concentrated at the regional level. The analysis shows, for example, that river floods will be the most economically significant widespread climate risk driver in the EU over the next two decades compounded by strong vulnerability to wildfires, heat and water stress in some regions. Around 30% of the euro area banking sector’s credit exposures to non-financial companies are to firms that are subject to a combination of these physical hazards.
Second, exposures to emission-intensive firms are concentrated not only across but also within economic sectors. Exposures to highly emitting firms occupy 14% of collective euro area banking sector balance sheets. While mainly concentrated in the manufacturing, electricity, transportation and construction sectors, they also vary considerably within sectors – suggesting scope for financial market repricing as widely varying emissions intensities narrow.
Third, exposures to climate risk drivers are concentrated in specific European financial intermediaries. Around 70% of banking system credit exposures to firms subject to high or increasing physical risk over the coming decades are concentrated in the portfolios of just 25 banks. At the same time, scope for financial market repricing associated with transition risk will be particularly large for investment funds, where more than 55% of investments are tilted toward high emitting firms and estimated alignment with the EU Taxonomy stands at only 1% of assets. While direct holdings by insurers of climate sensitive assets may be manageable, risks could be amplified by cross-holdings of investment funds of around 30%.
Long-term scenario analysis for EU banks, insurers and investment funds suggests that credit and market risk could increase as a result of a failure to effectively counteract global warming. In the projected scenario modelling what would happen in the event of an insufficiently orderly climate transition, physical risk losses – particularly for high emitting firms – would become dominant in around 15 years. This could lead to a decline in global GDP of up to 20% by the end of the century should mitigation prove to be insufficient or ineffective.
As work continues on more accurately measuring and modelling climate risk, the advances described in this report should provide valuable evidence to inform the broadening climate debate in the public and private sector alike.

ESMA reporting templates to be used as of 1 October 2021, replacing the current ECB templates
All asset-backed securities (ABSs) seeking collateral eligibility are subject to the same Eurosystem loan-level data requirements, regardless of any disclosure exemption under the Securitisation Regulation
New reporting template for non-marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims (DECCs)
In March 2019, the ECB decided

that the loan-level data reporting requirements of the Eurosystem collateral framework will converge towards the disclosure requirements specified in the Securitisation Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/2402). Today, the ECB announces that the “ESMA reporting activation date”

]
occurred on 25 June 2021, when all related conditions were fulfilled.
Consequently, the new loan-level data rules will enter into effect after a transitional period of three months from the ESMA reporting activation date. As of 1 October 2021, ABSs under the scope of the Securitisation Regulation will only be assessed for compliance against Eurosystem collateral eligibility criteria if loan-level data is submitted to an ESMA-registered securitisation repository and according to the templates developed by ESMA.

All ABSs seeking eligibility as Eurosystem collateral are subject to the same loan-level data requirements, regardless of any exemption from the disclosure requirements under the Securitisation Regulation. Therefore, eligible ABS issuers are required to provide information to the Eurosystem according to the procedures established in Sections 1 and 2 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1224 of 16 October 2019,

which entails the submission of investor reports, as well as templates on underlying exposures, inside information and significant events.
For eligible ABS transactions issued prior to 1 January 2019 that are not subject to the Securitisation Regulation, the Eurosystem’s current loan-level data reporting requirements will be maintained for a period of three years until 30 September 2024. After that date, ECB ABS loan-level data templates are phased out and those ABSs will equally be subject to the procedures established in Sections 1 and 2 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1224 of 16 October 2019, as a Eurosystem eligibility requirement.
Lastly, to ensure that non-marketable debt instruments backed by eligible credit claims (DECCs) can comply with their respective loan-level data requirements, the ECB has created a specific ECB SME DECC template.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has published the consolidated banking data with reference to end-2020, a dataset of the EU banking system compiled on a group consolidated basis.
The annual CBD cover information required for the analysis of the EU banking sector, comprising a broader set of data than the quarterly release. The end-December 2020 data refer to 327 banking groups and 2,593 stand-alone credit institutions operating in the EU (including foreign subsidiaries and branches), covering nearly 100% of the EU banking sector balance sheet. This dataset includes an extensive range of indicators on profitability and efficiency, balance sheets, liquidity and funding, asset quality, asset encumbrance, capital adequacy and solvency. Aggregates and indicators are published for the full sample of the banking industry.
Large reporters apply International Financial Reporting Standards and the Implementing Technical Standards on supervisory reporting of the European Banking Authority, while some smaller reporters may apply national accounting standards. Accordingly, aggregates and indicators may also cover data based on national accounting standards, depending on the availability of the underlying items.
A few revisions to past data are disclosed together with the end-December 2020 data.

First in-person meeting since March 2020 took place over weekend
Informal in-depth discussion about ECB’s strategy review
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) convened on 18-20 June 2021 in the Taunus region close to Frankfurt am Main for its annual retreat. It was the first in-person meeting of the members of the Governing Council since March 2020.
The retreat focused on advancing the discussions about the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review. The topics addressed by the review included, among others, the definition and measurement of price stability, the underlying analytical framework, the medium-term orientation, the role of climate change in formulating monetary policy, and the modernisation of policy communication.
“It was good to meet again in-person and the hilly Taunus countryside was ideal to reconnect after months of only digital meetings”, ECB President, Christine Lagarde, said. “I am glad we were able to have in-depth discussions and we made good progress in shaping the concrete features of our future monetary policy strategy at our retreat.”
The ECB’s Governing Council will make the outcome of the strategy review public after taking formal decisions.

ECB’s Governing Council issues opinion confirming that exceptional circumstances warranting leverage ratio relief still exist
Opinion instrumental in ECB Banking Supervision’s decision to allow banks to exclude certain central bank exposures from leverage ratio
ECB Banking Supervision also publishes announcement on leverage ratio
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided that it concurs with ECB Banking Supervision in that there continue to be “exceptional circumstances” allowing for the extension of the temporary exclusion of certain central bank exposures from the leverage ratio in order to support the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy. The Governing Council is of the view that the condition of exceptional circumstances warranting this temporary exclusion from the calculation of banks’ total exposure measure continues to be met for the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council concurs that on a quarterly basis the date on which the exceptional circumstances are deemed to have started is 31 December 2019. Euro area national competent authorities intending to exercise the discretion provided for under Article 429a of the Capital Requirements Regulation in relation to less significant institutions may rely upon this opinion issued by the ECB as monetary authority of the euro area.
The opinion of the Governing Council is a precondition for ECB Banking Supervision to allow significant banks in the euro area, which it supervises directly, to exclude certain central bank exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio.

At today’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to confirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance:
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects net purchases under the PEPP over the coming quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.
The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.
The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Finally, the Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. The funding obtained through the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) plays a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households.
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Euro remains unchallenged as second most widely used currency globally after the US dollar
International role of the euro is broadly stable after the pandemic shock
Euro plays large role in international green bond markets
The international role of the euro remained broadly stable in 2020. This was one of the main findings in the latest annual review of the international role of the euro, published today by the European Central Bank (ECB). “The euro remains unchallenged as the second most widely used currency globally after the US dollar”, said ECB President Christine Lagarde.
The share of the euro across various indicators of international currency was stable, averaging around 19% in 2020.
More specifically, the euro’s share in outstanding international loans, in the stock of international debt securities and as an invoicing currency for extra-euro area imports of goods remained broadly stable. The share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves declined, as did the share of the euro in foreign currency-denominated debt issuance and in outstanding international deposits.
The euro remained a key currency in international green bond markets, a small but rapidly growing segment of international debt security markets. Over half of the green bonds issued globally in 2020 were in euro. For international issuance (i.e. bond issues by non-nationals), about one-third of green bonds issued in 2020 were denominated in euro, which represented a threefold increase compared with 2016.
The relative resilience of the international role of the euro despite the pandemic shock stands in contrast to the significant decline observed in the wake of the euro area sovereign debt crisis. “To some extent, this development may reflect the effectiveness of the unprecedented policy support measures and coordinated approach that have prevailed in the euro area during the COVID-19 crisis,” said ECB President Lagarde.
Looking ahead, the international role of the euro will be primarily supported by a deeper and more complete Economic and Monetary Union, including advancing the capital markets union, in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area. The Eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete Economic and Monetary Union.
The report also contains three special features. One of them examines how the issuance of a central bank digital currency could impact the international role of currencies. “Depending on its design, a central bank digital currency may support the use of a currency in cross-border payments. However, fundamental forces, such as the quality of economic policies and institutions, as well as the depth of markets, remain the most important factors for international currency status,” said Fabio Panetta, member of the ECB’s Executive Board. Another special feature considers the implications for the international role of the euro of the European Union and ECB policy responses to the pandemic. The third special feature presents a new dataset that offers a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of how major currencies are used in global trade invoicing.

SME turnover and profits continued to deteriorate, but business activity expected to improve
Availability of external finance improved marginally, but not for the smallest firms
Recruiting skilled employees and finding customers are main concerns
For the period from October 2020 to March 2021, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the euro area reported a further deterioration in their turnover and profits, reflecting the weakness of economic activity, albeit less so than in the first wave of the pandemic (with net percentages of -29% (up from -46%) for turnover and -35% (up from -47%) for profits).
[
1
]
The resurgence in commodity prices triggered a jump in the net percentage of euro area SMEs reporting an increase in the cost of materials and energy (36%, up from 11%). At the same time, after forecasting declines in the two previous survey rounds, SMEs expected turnover to increase over the next six months (19%, up from -9%).
After one year of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, euro area SMEs reported that difficulties in recruiting skilled labour (21%) and finding customers (20%) were the main concerns for their business activity. Concerns about access to finance remained low in the euro area as a whole (9%). The net percentage of SMEs reporting an improvement in the availability of bank loans declined marginally to stand at 3% (down from 6%). The slight improvement in the availability of bank loans was broad-based across countries, with few exceptions. That was not the case, however, for micro firms (defined as firms with fewer than ten employees), which signalled a decline in the availability of bank loans for the first time since mid-2015 (-2%). In contrast, large companies indicated that the availability of bank loans had returned to pre-COVID-19 levels. SMEs’ external financing gap – the difference between the change in demand for and the change in the availability of external financing – remained positive, both at the euro area level (4%, down from 5%) and across all euro area countries. SMEs also indicated that the supply of trade credit remained unchanged (0%, up from -1%), while a net 6% of euro area SMEs reported an increase in the availability of leasing or hire-purchase (up from 3%). For most external financing sources, there are now fewer SMEs expecting a deterioration in availability in the future.
In this survey round, a smaller net percentage of SMEs reported that the economic environment had adversely affected the availability of external financing (-29%, up from -41%). That net percentage is comparable to the levels seen prior to the pandemic and may point to the beneficial impact of the ongoing policy support measures. Similarly, fewer SMEs reported that their firm-specific outlooks (-15%) and capital positions (-2%) had deteriorated.
Replies to ad hoc questions on the importance of government support schemes introduced in response to the pandemic show that a large number of SMEs accessed such schemes over the last 12 months and that the measures have helped firms to meet their immediate and short-term obligations. In particular, firms highlighted government measures aimed at alleviating wage bills and providing support in the form of tax cuts and tax moratoria. SMEs also indicated that government measures that were currently in place or planned on account of the pandemic would increase their ability to meet their debt obligations in the next two years (i.e. beyond the short term).
SMEs reported that they expected to see an economic recovery in the coming months. Firms in all size categories expected, in net terms, to see increases in turnover over the next six months, suggesting a widespread recovery in business activity. Firm size was, however, a fundamental factor in those expectations, with larger companies reporting the highest expectations (45%) and micro SMEs signalling more modest expectations (12%).
This report presents the main results of the 24th round of the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) in the euro area, which was conducted between 8 March and 22 April 2021. The survey covered the period from October 2020 to March 2021. The sample comprised 11,007 enterprises in the euro area, of which 10,054 (91%) were SMEs (i.e. firms with fewer than 250 employees).

Number of bank branches continued to decline in most EU Member States, by 8.62% on average
Number of bank employees decreased by 1.55% on average
Degree of banking sector concentration continues to differ widely across countries
The European Central Bank (ECB) has updated its dataset of structural financial indicators for the banking sector in the European Union (EU) for the end of 2020. This annual dataset comprises statistics on the number of branches and employees of EU credit institutions, data on the degree of concentration of the banking sector in each EU Member State and data on foreign-controlled institutions in EU national banking markets.
The structural financial indicators show a further decline in the number of bank branches in the EU, averaging 8.62% across Member States. Contractions were observed in 24 of the 27 countries, ranging from -2.28% to -30.66%. The total number of branches in the EU was 143,158 at the end of 2020, 82.8% located in the euro area.
In the course of 2020, the number of employees of credit institutions fell in 22 EU Member States, with an average drop of 1.55% across all countries. This decrease in the number of bank employees is a trend that has been observed in most countries since 2008.
The data also indicate that the degree of concentration in the banking sector (measured by the share of assets held by the five largest banks) continues to vary considerably between EU Member States. At the national level the share of total assets of the five largest credit institutions ranged from 31.60% to 97.03%, while the EU average was 67.25% at the end of 2020.
The structural financial indicators are published by the ECB on an annual basis.

Uneven economic impact of pandemic implies risks concentrated in specific sectors and countries
Banks’ asset quality holding up, but profitability weak and potential for credit risk to worsen
Disorderly corrections in financial market segments may affect non-banks that have large exposures to corporates with weak fundamentals
The uneven economic impact of the pandemic means that financial stability risks are concentrated in specific sectors and countries, often with higher pre-existing vulnerabilities, concludes the May 2021 Financial Stability Review (FSR) of the European Central Bank (ECB).
“As the euro area emerges from the third wave of the pandemic, risks to financial stability remain elevated and have become more unevenly distributed. A higher corporate debt burden in countries with larger services sectors could increase pressure on governments and banks in these countries,” said Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB. “Extensive policy support, particularly for corporates, could gradually move from being broad-based to more targeted,” he added.
Policy measures helped corporate insolvencies to fall to historic lows during the pandemic . However, as this support is gradually removed, considerably higher insolvency rates than before the pandemic cannot be ruled out, especially in certain euro area countries. This in turn could weigh on sovereigns and banks which provided support to corporates during the pandemic.
In parallel, the last six months have seen continued rallies in many financial markets and higher prices in euro area residential real estate markets, increasing worries about overvaluation and the potential for abrupt asset price corrections. Recent increases in US benchmark yields have revived concerns about the potential for shifts in financial conditions. This could affect indebted corporates, households, sovereigns and those investors that have become increasingly exposed to duration, credit and liquidity risk in recent years.
Market sentiment towards banks has substantially improved, as reflected by a marked rise in bank stock prices since the trough last October. However, bank profitability remains weak, while prospects for lending demand are uncertain. Bank asset quality has been preserved so far, but credit risk may materialise with a lag, implying a need for increased loan loss provisions. Effective NPL solutions and full use of available capital buffers are needed to support the recovery.
Non-banks continue to have large exposures to corporates with weak fundamentals and are sensitive to a yield shock given their material bond portfolio duration, exposure to US markets and high degree of liquidity risk.
This edition of the FSR also includes new analysis about the impact of climate change on financial stability in the euro area. A significant share of bank loan exposures to corporates could be subject to a high level of climate-related physical risk, directly affecting firms’ operations or the physical collateral used to secure loans. Both the assessment of risks and the allocation of financing to support the transition to a greener economy can benefit from enhanced disclosures and data, as well as clearer green finance standards. Preliminary results from climate stress testing indicate clear benefits from acting early.

Working group recommendations should help EURIBOR users comply with EU Benchmarks Regulation fallback obligations
Key milestone reached with publication of recommendations as working group enters new phase and secretariat passes from ECB to ESMA
The private sector working group on euro risk-free rates has today published its recommendations addressing events that would trigger fallbacks in EURIBOR-related contracts, as well as €STR-based EURIBOR fallback rates (rates that could be used if a fallback is triggered). While there is currently no plan to discontinue EURIBOR, the development of more robust fallback language addresses the risk of a potential permanent discontinuation and is in line with the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR). The valuable feedback from the two market-wide consultations on the draft recommendations has been taken into account in the final recommendations.
As with similar fora in other currency areas, the working group’s recommendations are not legally binding for market participants. They do, however, provide guidance and represent the prevailing market consensus on EURIBOR fallback trigger events and €STR-based fallback rates, which market participants may consider in their contracts.
The decision approving these recommendations was unanimous.
Now that the working group on risk-free rates has delivered the last of its predefined deliverables, it will focus more on monitoring benchmark rate developments in general. It has been decided that the secretariat will move to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which, as provided for in the BMR, will supervise the administrator of EURIBOR as of 2022. This means that the working group’s publications will, from now on, be available on ESMA’s website. Communication aspects (media enquiries, newsletter, etc.) will also be taken over by ESMA.
For media queries, please contact William Lelieveldt, tel.: +49 69 1344 7316.
Notes
Fallbacks deal with the risk that a benchmark rate used in a financial contract becomes unavailable and that the benchmark rate used “falls back” to another rate. Under the EU Benchmarks Regulation, users of benchmarks are required to have fallback arrangements in their contracts.
The working group on euro risk-free rates, for which the European Central Bank (ECB) currently provides the secretariat, is an industry-led group established in 2018 by the ECB, the Financial Services and Markets Authority, ESMA and the European Commission. Its main tasks are to identify and recommend alternative risk-free rates and transition paths (see Terms of reference). The secretariat of the group will pass from the ECB to ESMA on 11 May 2021."

Money market activity dominated by secured and foreign exchange swap segments
Secured interest rates backed by collateral issued in different euro area countries converged, facilitating monetary policy transmission
Monetary policy measures helped to alleviate temporary turbulences in some parts of euro money market
The Euro money market study 2020 finds that activity in the euro money market is still concentrated in the secured and foreign exchange swap segments, with the former accounting for about half of the total outstanding amounts. Secured interest rates backed by collateral issued in different euro area countries converged, facilitating a smooth transmission of monetary policy.
The study also reveals the contrast between the resilience of the secured segment and the bouts of turbulence experienced in the foreign exchange swap, short-term securities and unsecured term segments observed during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. It outlines how the Eurosystem monetary policy measures implemented since March 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19-related market tensions were successful in alleviating the rate disruptions of the three most affected money market segments, which returned to normal functioning in the course of the second half of 2020 and have remained stable ever since. The study also analyses the introduction of the new euro short-term rate (€STR), the ECB deposit facility interest rate cut in September 2019, the implementation of a two-tier system for remunerating credit institutions’ excess reserve holdings and the impact of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on the euro money market activity.
The European Central Bank’s Euro money market study 2020 provides a detailed overview of the euro money markets. It focuses on key developments and dynamics in five market segments: secured, unsecured, short-term securities, foreign exchange swaps and overnight index swaps. The study is based on daily transactions in the euro money market collected from the largest euro area banks under the Money Market Statistical Regulation

HICP inflation expectations revised up for 2021 but otherwise largely unchanged
Real GDP growth expectations revised downward in 2021 and upward in 2022, implying a further delay in recovery
Unemployment rate expectations revised downward for 2021-23, with longer-term expectations unchanged
In the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the second quarter of 2021, HICP inflation expectations stood at 1.6%, 1.3% and 1.5% for 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Compared with the previous round for the first quarter of 2021, these were revised upward by 0.7 percentage points for 2021 but unchanged for 2022 and 2023. Respondents reported that they considered the factors behind the upward revision for 2021 to be largely temporary. Longer-term inflation expectations (for 2025) stood at 1.7%, also unchanged compared with the previous round
Regarding GDP growth, SPF respondents revised down their expectations for 2021 but up for 2022, implying a further delay in the expected recovery. The expectations imply a return of GDP during 2022 to above its 2019 level. However, this would still be 2.6% lower than the level for 2022 implied in the survey round for the first quarter of 2020, i.e. before Europe was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were unchanged at 1.4%.
The profile of unemployment has been revised down for 2021-23 but longer-term expectations were unchanged at 7.4% for 2025, implying an overall slightly less pronounced downward trajectory.

ECB and other major central banks decided to discontinue 84-day US dollar liquidity operations
Change will be effective as of 1 July 2021
ECB and other major central banks stand ready to re-adjust provision of US dollar liquidity, including restarting 84-day operations, as warranted by market conditions
In view of the sustained improvements in US dollar funding conditions and low demand at recent US dollar liquidity-providing operations, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, have jointly decided to discontinue offering US dollar liquidity at the 84-day maturity. This operational change will be effective as of 1 July 2021. The auction schedule until 30 June 2021, as already published, remains unchanged. From 1 July 2021 onwards, these central banks will continue to hold weekly operations with a 7-day maturity.
These central banks stand ready to re-adjust the provision of US dollar liquidity, including restarting the 84-day operation, as warranted by market conditions. The swap lines among these central banks are available standing facilities and serve as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets, thereby helping to mitigate the effects of such strains on the supply of credit to households and businesses, both domestically and abroad.

At today’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance:
The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
The Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Since the incoming information confirmed the joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook carried out at the March monetary policy meeting, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the current quarter to continue to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of the year.
The Governing Council will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.
The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Finally, the Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) has registered a high take-up of funds. The funding obtained through TLTRO III plays a crucial role in supporting bank lending to firms and households.
The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards for loans to firms tightened moderately
Demand for loans by firms and households decreased
ECB’s monetary policy measures remain supportive of lending conditions and volumes
According to the April 2021 euro area bank lending survey (BLS), credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – tightened moderately for loans or credit lines to enterprises (net percentage of banks standing at 7%, see Chart 1) in the first quarter of 2021. Credit standards eased slightly in net terms for loans to households for house purchase (net percentage of -2%) and tightened moderately further in net terms for consumer credit and other lending to households (net percentage of 5%). Banks referred mainly to risk perceptions related to borrowers’ creditworthiness and a lower risk tolerance as factors having a tightening impact on their credit standards. By contrast, competitive pressure contributed mostly to an easing of credit standards. In the second quarter of 2021, banks expect credit standards to tighten for loans to firms and households.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts – remained unchanged for loans to firms and eased, on balance, for housing loans in the first quarter of 2021. In both cases, margins on average loans narrowed while banks reported wider margins for riskier loans in net terms.
Banks reported, on balance, a further decline in firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines in the first quarter of 2021, i.e. a larger percentage of banks indicated a decline rather than an increase in firms’ loan demand (see Chart 2). Financing needs for fixed investment continued to dampen loan demand as firms, especially in sectors more affected by the pandemic, tended to postpone investment. In addition, firms did not, on balance, demand additional financing for working capital, reflecting the availability of liquidity buffers and direct government liquidity support, especially to small and medium-sized enterprises. Banks also reported a net decrease in demand for housing loans in the first quarter of 2021. While consumer confidence dampened demand for housing loans, demand continued to be supported by the low general level of interest rates and, to a lesser extent, housing market prospects. For consumer credit and other lending to households, a larger net percentage of banks reported a decline in demand, driven mainly by lower consumer confidence and decreased spending on durable goods. In the second quarter of 2021, banks expect net demand to increase for loans to firms and households.
Euro area banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding continued to improve in the first quarter of 2021, according to the banks surveyed. The BLS also asked banks to report on the impact of the ECB’s monetary policy measures on bank lending. The ECB’s asset purchase programme (APP), the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) all had a positive impact on banks’ liquidity positions and market financing conditions. These measures, as well as the ECB’s negative deposit facility rate, had an easing impact on bank lending conditions and a positive impact on lending volumes, mainly for loans to firms. TLTRO III in particular has strongly supported bank lending over the past six months. At the same time, banks indicated a negative impact of the ECB’s asset purchases and the negative deposit facility rate on their profitability through a negative impact on their net interest income. This was mitigated by the ECB’s two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of bank lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the April 2021 survey relate to changes observed in the first quarter of 2021 and expected changes in the second quarter of 2021, unless otherwise indicated. The April 2021 survey round was conducted between 11 and 26 March 2021. A total of 143 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Credit terms and conditions slightly eased for all counterparty types except hedge funds, while hedge fund use of financial leverage increased
Maximum maturity of funding increased for many types of collateral, while haircuts and financing rates/spreads decreased for funding secured by all types of collateral
Demand for funding continued to weaken across all collateral types
Overall terms and conditions for securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives transactions broadly unchanged compared with previous year but some divergence among different counterparty types
Overall credit terms and conditions slightly eased over the December 2020 to February 2021 review period. Respondents reported an easing of overall credit terms for each individual counterparty type except hedge funds, for which overall credit terms remained unchanged. The reported easing of overall credit terms was most pronounced for banks and dealers, followed by insurance companies. It was attributed to a general improvement in market liquidity and functioning, increased availability of balance sheet or capital, competition from other institutions, an increased willingness of institutions to take on risk, and the practices of central counterparties. Respondents expected overall terms to remain broadly unchanged over the March 2021 to May 2021 period.
The availability and use of financial leverage increased for hedge funds while the use of leverage by investment firms decreased. Pressure from all counterparty types to obtain more favourable conditions increased and was most pronounced from non-financial corporates. At the same time, there was no change in the provision of differential terms to most-favoured clients over the reference period.
While the overall view on the maximum amount of funding against different types of euro-denominated collateral was mixed, respondents reported that the maximum maturity of funding against euro-denominated collateral increased for many collateral types, that haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral decreased for almost all types of collateral, and that financing rates/spreads continued to decrease for funding secured by all types of collateral.
A significant share of survey respondents reported that demand for funding of all collateral types continued to weaken further. The liquidity of collateral improved for most collateral types.
Respondents only reported limited changes with respect to non-centrally cleared over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.
As in previous years, specific questions included in the March 2021 survey sought to provide a long-term perspective by comparing credit terms and conditions observed in early March 2021 with those observed and reported in the previous year (i.e. in early March 2020). Compared with the previous year, overall terms and conditions for securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions were broadly unchanged on balance but with some divergence among different counterparty types. In net terms, credit standards for secured funding eased compared with the previous year. Survey respondents reported that non-price conditions in OTC derivatives markets tightened for most types of derivatives relative to the previous year.
The March 2021 SESFOD, the underlying detailed data series and the SESFOD guidelines are available on the European Central Bank website together with all other SESFOD publications.
The SESFOD is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The March 2021 survey collected qualitative information on changes between December 2020 and February 2021. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

Citizens and professionals alike value privacy most for possible future digital euro
Preference for a digital euro being integrated into existing banking and payment systems
Public consultation provides valuable input for Eurosystem’s decision in mid-2021 on starting formal investigation on digital euro
The European Central Bank (ECB) has published today a comprehensive analysis of its public consultation on a digital euro. The analysis confirms, by and large, our initial findings: what the public and professionals want the most from such a digital currency is privacy (43%), followed by security (18%), the ability to pay across the euro area (11%), no additional costs (9%) and offline usability (8%).
“A digital euro can only be successful if it meets the needs of Europeans,” says ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. “We will do our best to ensure that a digital euro meets the expectations of citizens highlighted in the public consultation.”
Privacy is the most important feature of a digital euro for both the public and professionals, especially merchants and other companies. Both groups support requirements to avoid illicit activities, with fewer than one in ten responses from members of the public showing support for full anonymity.
More than two-thirds of respondents acknowledge the importance of intermediaries providing innovative services that allow access to a digital euro and indicate that it should be integrated into existing banking and payment systems. They would like additional services provided on top of basic digital euro payments.
Around a quarter of respondents take the view that a digital euro should make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. They want the digital euro to be usable outside the euro area, though with limits.
The ECB received many technical suggestions from the respondents. According to a quarter of individual respondents, end-user solutions comprising (smart) cards or a secure element in smartphones would be preferred to facilitate cash-like features. Almost half mention a need for holding limits, tiered remuneration, or a combination of the two, to manage the amount of digital euro in circulation. A similar share of professional respondents agree.
The consultation was launched on 12 October 2020 and concluded on 12 January 2021, receiving over 8,200 responses – a record participation for an ECB public consultation. A large majority of respondents were private citizens (94%). The remaining participants were professionals, including banks, payment service providers, merchants and tech companies.
Most responses came from Germany (47%), Italy (15%) and France (11%). The answers are not necessarily representative of the views of the EU population as the consultation was open to everyone, and respondents participated on their own initiative. Still, they provide important input into the ECB’s analytical and experimental work and into the upcoming decision of the Governing Council on whether to launch a formal investigation phase in view of the possible issuance of a digital euro.

The Governing Council took the following decisions:
First, the Governing Council will continue to conduct net asset purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council expects purchases under the PEPP over the next quarter to be conducted at a significantly higher pace than during the first months of this year.

Overall credit terms and conditions unchanged but some divergence between price and non-price terms
Substantial decreases in financing rates/spreads for funding secured by all types of collateral except equities
Weaker demand for funding across all types of collateral except equities
Market-making activities increased in 2020 for both debt securities and derivatives owing to risk-taking and the growing importance of electronic trading platforms
Following significant changes in the previous three reporting periods, overall credit terms and conditions remained broadly unchanged over the September 2020 to November 2020 review period. At the same time, there was some divergence between price and non-price terms. Whereas price terms tightened slightly for all counterparties except banks and hedge funds, non-price terms eased on balance for all counterparty types. Respondents reported an easing in overall credit terms for each individual counterparty type. This was in line with the expectations expressed in the September 2020 survey. Looking ahead, a small net percentage of respondents expected overall terms to tighten over the December 2020 to February 2021 period.
Pressure from all counterparty types to obtain more favourable conditions increased, being most pronounced from hedge funds and non-financial corporates, while the provision of differential terms to most-favoured clients rose slightly over the reference period for almost all counterparty types but in particular for hedge funds.
Participants in the survey reported that the maximum amount of funding increased slightly or was unchanged on balance for many types of euro-denominated collateral. The maximum maturity of funding against euro-denominated collateral increased for most collateral types. Haircuts applied to euro-denominated collateral decreased for almost all types of collateral. Following the significant decreases reported in the previous SESFOD summary, respondents reported further substantial decreases in financing rates/spreads for funding secured by all types of collateral except equities. Demand for funding of all collateral types except equities continued to weaken. The liquidity of collateral improved for most collateral types.
Respondents also reported that initial margin requirements remained unchanged for almost all OTC derivatives except for credit derivatives referencing sovereigns. They reported very few changes for the maximum amount of exposure and maximum maturity of trades. Liquidity and trading deteriorated for commodity, foreign exchange and equity derivatives. However, a small net percentage of survey respondents reported an improvement in liquidity and trading for credit derivatives. Finally, the posting of non-standard collateral increased slightly.
The December 2020 survey included a number of special questions about market-making activities. Survey respondents reported that market-making activities increased for both debt securities and derivatives over the past year. Notable exceptions, for which market-making activities decreased, were asset-backed securities, high-yield corporate bonds and high-quality financial corporate bonds. Respondents reported willingness to take on risk and the growing importance of electronic trading platforms as the main drivers of changes and expected changes in market-making activities. Respondents expressed strong confidence in their ability to act as market-makers in times of stress for all asset classes. They reported willingness to take on risk as the main reason for banks’ ability to act as market-makers in times of stress.
The SESFOD is conducted four times a year and covers changes in credit terms and conditions over three-month reference periods ending in February, May, August and November. The December 2020 survey collected qualitative information on changes between September 2020 and November 2020. The results are based on responses from a panel of 26 large banks, comprising 14 euro area banks and 12 banks with head offices outside the euro area.

ECB profit amounted to €1.6 billion (2019: €2.4 billion) and is distributed in full to national central banks
Net interest income on securities held for monetary policy purposes: €1.3 billion (2019: €1.4 billion)
ECB’s Balance Sheet grew to €569 billion (2019: €457 billion)
The European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) audited financial statements for 2020 show that the profit for the year was €1,643 million (2019: €2,366 million). The €722 million decrease compared to the previous year was mainly due to lower net interest income on foreign reserve assets and on securities held for monetary policy purposes. Following a decision by the Governing Council, there was also a transfer of €48 million to the ECB’s provision for financial risks, which reduced the ECB’s profit by an equivalent amount.
Net interest income totalled €2,017 million in 2020 (2019: €2,686 million). Net interest income on foreign reserve assets decreased to €474 million (2019: €1,052 million), owing to lower interest income earned on the US dollar portfolio. Net interest income arising from securities held for monetary policy purposes decreased to €1,337 million (2019: €1,447 million), mainly due to lower interest income on the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) as a result of redemptions.
Realised gains arising from financial operations increased to €342 million (2019: €197 million). The increase was mainly due to higher price gains on sales of US dollar-denominated securities, as the decrease in US dollar bond yields in 2020 had a positive impact on their market value.
Write-downs amounted to €26 million (2019: €20 million), mainly stemming from unrealised price losses on securities held in the US dollar portfolio and unrealised exchange rate losses arising from the Chinese renminbi holding.
Impairment tests are conducted on the securities held by the ECB in its monetary policy portfolios, which are valued at amortised cost (subject to impairment). Based on the results of these tests, no impairment losses have been recorded for these portfolios.
Total staff costs increased to €646 million (2019: €566 million) as a result of the higher average number of staff in 2020, predominately in banking supervision, and higher charges in relation to post-employment benefits arising from the actuarial valuation at the end of 2020. Other administrative expenses decreased to €553 million (2019: €590 million), mainly owing to a decrease in expenses related to external consultancy support and business travel.
Supervisory fee income, derived from fees charged to recover expenses incurred by the ECB in the performance of its supervisory tasks, amounted to €535 million (2019: €537 million). The slight decrease in 2020 was driven by the lower administrative expenses in relation to supervisory tasks, which more than offset the higher staff costs as a result of the higher average number of staff working in banking supervision.
The ECB’s profit is distributed to the euro area national central banks (NCBs). The Governing Council decided to make an interim profit distribution, amounting to €1,260 million, to the euro area NCBs on 29 January 2021. At yesterday’s meeting, the Governing Council decided to distribute the remainder of the profit, amounting to €383 million, on 19 February 2021.
The total size of the ECB’s Balance Sheet increased by €112 billion to €569 billion (2019: €457 billion). This increase was mainly due to the securities purchased under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) and the asset purchase programme (APP).
At the end of 2020 the size of the consolidated balance sheet of the Eurosystem, which comprises assets and liabilities of the euro area NCBs and of the ECB vis-à-vis third parties, stood at €6,979 billion (2019: €4,671 billion). The growth compared to the previous year was mainly due to the increase in Eurosystem refinancing operations, as a result of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III), and the securities purchased under the PEPP and the APP.
The Eurosystem’s holdings of securities held for monetary policy purposes rose by €1,063 billion to €3,695 billion (2019: €2,632 billion). The APP holdings increased by €330 billion to €2,909 billion and the PEPP purchases amounted to €754 billion.

Survey runs eight times a year, ahead of each Governing Council monetary policy meeting
The European Central Bank (ECB) announces today that it will begin publishing aggregate results of its Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA) in June 2021. The survey, an ECB staff-level exercise, collects information on market participants’ expectations about the future evolution of key monetary policy parameters, financial market variables and the economy. The survey runs eight times a year and is aligned with the six-week schedule of the monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council.
Following the successful completion of a pilot phase, which ran from April 2019, the ECB will start publishing the survey results in aggregate form for each round on the Friday the week after the Governing Council. The first survey results to be published on 18 June 2021 will be those of the June 2021 SMA.
The ECB selects survey respondents through selection criteria that include market relevance, geographical representativeness, commitment to participating regularly in subsequent rounds of the survey, and whether the institution is actively involved in the areas of activity covered by the survey. The list of survey respondents is published on the ECB’s website.

Eurosystem agrees on common stance for climate change-related sustainable and responsible investment principles for euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios
Common stance promotes disclosures and understanding of climate-related risks
Eurosystem aims to start climate-related disclosures for these types of portfolios within two years
The Eurosystem central banks – the 19 national central banks of the euro area countries and the European Central Bank (ECB) – have defined a common stance for applying sustainable and responsible investment principles in the euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios that they each manage under their own responsibility. The common agreement follows extensive preparatory work within the Eurosystem and has also benefited from the analysis of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and is aligned with its recommendations. Several Eurosystem members – including the ECB – already apply sustainable and responsible investment practices in the management of their non-monetary policy portfolios.
The common stance will help all Eurosystem members to contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy and to EU climate goals. It will increase the awareness and understanding of climate risks while promoting climate-related disclosures.
The common stance prepares the ground for the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and other sustainable and responsible investment-related metrics of these portfolios. The Eurosystem aims to start making annual climate-related disclosures for these types of portfolios within the next two years, using the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as the initial framework and reporting, as a minimum, in the category of metrics and targets. Several Eurosystem central banks already make climate-related disclosures for some of their non-monetary policy portfolios.
The Eurosystem members are solely responsible for their non-monetary policy portfolios. They have agreed to continue to work jointly on the common stance and its implementation to harmonise approaches.

ECB decided to extend temporary euro liquidity lines by nine months to March 2022
Objective of these euro liquidity lines is to address possible euro liquidity needs in non-euro area countries in presence of market dysfunctions due to COVID-19
The European Central Bank (ECB) decided in December 2020 to offer a nine-month extension of its temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks. The central banks of Albania, Croatia, Hungary, the Republic of North Macedonia, Romania, San Marino and Serbia have agreed to extend the duration of their euro liquidity lines with the ECB to March 2022.
The lines were established earlier in 2020 to provide euro liquidity to financial institutions in the respective countries via the corresponding national central banks. The objective of these euro liquidity lines is to address possible euro liquidity needs in non-euro area countries in the presence of market dysfunctions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they aim at preventing spillback effects on euro area financial markets and economies that might adversely impact the smooth transmission of ECB monetary policy. The temporary euro liquidity lines had previously been set to expire in June 2021.
Through a swap line agreement, Hrvatska narodna banka (Croatian National Bank) can borrow up to €2 billion from the ECB in exchange for Croatian kuna.
Under their respective repo line agreements:
Banka e Shqipërisë (Bank of Albania) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
Magyar Nemzeti Bank can borrow up to €4 billion from the ECB
Народна банка на Република Северна Македонија (National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia) can borrow up to €400 million from the ECB
Banca Naţională a României (National Bank of Romania) can borrow up to €4.5 billion from the ECB
Banca Centrale della Repubblica di San Marino (Central Bank of the Republic of San Marino) can borrow up to €100 million from the ECB
Народна банка Србије (National Bank of Serbia) can borrow up to €1 billion from the ECB
Under a repo line, central banks can borrow euro up to the specified limit in exchange for adequate euro-denominated collateral.

New unit, operational as of early 2021, to strengthen and bring together ECB work on climate
Decision reflects growing importance of climate change for the economy and the ECB’s policy
Climate change centre will shape and steer climate agenda
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to set up a climate change centre to bring together the work on climate issues in different parts of the bank. This decision reflects the growing importance of climate change for the economy and the ECB’s policy, as well as the need for a more structured approach to strategic planning and coordination.
The new unit, which will consist of about ten staff working with existing teams across the bank, will report to the ECB’s President, Christine Lagarde, who oversees the ECB’s work on climate change and sustainable finance.
“Climate change affects all of our policy areas,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde. “The climate change centre provides the structure we need to tackle the issue with the urgency and determination that it deserves.”
The climate change centre will shape and steer the ECB’s climate agenda internally and externally, building on the expertise of all teams already working on climate-related topics. Its activities will be organised in workstreams, ranging from monetary policy to prudential functions, and supported by staff that have data and climate change expertise. The climate change centre will start its work in early 2021.
The new structure will be reviewed after three years, as the aim is to ultimately incorporate climate considerations into the routine business of the ECB.
For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162.
Notes
The five work streams of the climate change centre focus on: 1) financial stability and prudential policy; 2) macroeconomic analysis and monetary policy; 3) financial market operations and risk; 4) EU policy and financial regulation; and 5) corporate sustainability."

ECB to use own funds portfolio to invest in BIS’ euro-denominated green bond fund
BIS’ fund invests in renewable energy production and energy efficiency projects
Step marks ECB’s contribution to environmental objectives and EU climate goals
The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to use part of its own funds portfolio to invest in the euro-denominated green bond investment fund for central banks (EUR BISIP G2) introduced by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). With this investment, the ECB contributes, within its mandate, to global efforts to promote environmental objectives – including the EU climate goals – and to combat climate change. The BIS green bond fund invests in renewable energy production, energy efficiency and other environmentally friendly projects.
This investment in the EUR BISIP G2 is part of the ECB’s sustainable and responsible investment (SRI) strategy that targets an increase in the share of green securities in its own funds portfolio. Such investment complements direct purchases of green bonds in secondary markets. The ECB already holds green bonds amounting to 3.5% of its own funds portfolio, which has a total market value of €20.8 billion. The ECB plans to increase this share over the coming years.
The EUR BISIP G2 is part of the BIS’s green bond fund initiative, which helps central banks to incorporate environmental sustainability objectives in the management of their reserves and capital. In September 2019, the BIS launched a US-dollar-denominated green bond fund under the same initiative.
The ECB is also taking steps to increase sustainable and responsible investments in its staff pension fund. In 2020 all conventional equity benchmark indices tracked by the staff pension fund were replaced with low-carbon equivalents, which has significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the equity funds. The ECB is exploring a possible expansion of use of low-carbon benchmark indices to fixed-income asset classes within its pension fund.
The ECB is a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, the international network of central banks, supervisors and international organisations promoting environmental responsibility in the financial sector.
For media queries, please contact Eva Taylor, tel.: +49 69 1344 7162.
Notes
The ECB’s own funds portfolio predominantly invests the ECB’s financial resources, namely its paid-up capital, amounts held in the general reserve fund and the provision for financial risks. Due to the reinvestment of income proceeds and the valuation of securities at market prices, the own funds portfolio and the financial resources do not necessarily correspond in size. The purpose of this portfolio is to provide income to help fund the ECB’s operating expenses which are not related to the delivery of its supervisory tasks.
The ECB staff pension fund is passively managed by two external asset managers. It pursues a broad sustainable and responsible investment policy based on limited exclusions and proxy voting guidelines that are incorporating environmental, social and governance standards.

Shorter-term inflation expectations largely unchanged; longer-term inflation expectations unchanged at 1.7%
Opposing revisions to real GDP growth outlook, with near-term forecasts revised down but stronger rebound envisaged thereafter
Unemployment rate expectations revised down across all horizons
Respondents to the European Central Bank (ECB) Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) for the first quarter of 2021 reported point forecasts for annual HICP inflation averaging 0.9%, 1.3% and 1.5% for 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively. These were unchanged for both 2021 and 2022. Average longer-term inflation expectations (which, like all other longer-term expectations in this round of the SPF, refer to 2025) remained at 1.7%.
The expectations of SPF respondents for euro area real GDP growth averaged 4.4%, 3.7% and 1.9% for 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively. These figures represent revisions from the previous round amounting to -0.9 percentage points for 2021 and +1.1 percentage points for 2022. Average longer-term expectations for real GDP growth were unchanged at 1.4%.
Average unemployment rate expectations stood at 8.9%, 8.3% and 7.8% for 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively. These represent downward revisions of 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points for 2021 and 2022. Expectations for the unemployment rate in the longer term were revised down 0.2 percentage points to 7.4%."

460,000 counterfeit euro banknotes withdrawn from circulation in 2020, a historically low level in proportion to banknotes in circulation
About two thirds of the total were €20 and €50 banknotes
Euro banknotes continue to be a trusted and safe means of payment
All euro banknotes can be verified using the “feel, look and tilt” method
Some 460,000 counterfeit euro banknotes were withdrawn from circulation in 2020 (220,000 in the second half of the year), a decrease of 17.7% when compared with 2019. €20 and €50 notes continued to be the most counterfeited banknotes, jointly accounting for about two thirds of the total. 94.5% of counterfeits were found in euro area countries, while 2.8% were found in non-euro area EU Member States and 2.7% in other parts of the world.
The likelihood of receiving a counterfeit is very small, as the number of counterfeits remains very low compared to the over 25 billion euro banknotes in circulation. In 2020, 17 counterfeits were detected per 1 million genuine banknotes in circulation, a historically low level (see the chart below).
Low-quality reproductions are continuously withdrawn from circulation. All are easy to detect as they have no security features, or only very poor imitations of them. Ever since the first series of euro banknotes was issued, the Eurosystem – i.e. the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 19 national central banks of the euro area – has encouraged people to be vigilant when receiving banknotes. You can check your notes by using the simple “feel, look and tilt” method described in the dedicated section of the ECB’s website and on the websites of the national central banks. The Eurosystem also helps professional cash handlers ensure that banknote-handling and processing machines can reliably identify counterfeits and withdraw them from circulation.
Using counterfeits for payments is a criminal offence that may lead to prosecution.  If you receive a suspect banknote, compare it directly with one you know to be genuine. If your suspicions are confirmed please contact the police or – depending on national practice – your national central bank or your own retail or commercial bank. The Eurosystem supports law enforcement agencies in their fight against currency counterfeiting.
The Eurosystem has a duty to safeguard the integrity of euro banknotes and to continue improving banknote technology. The second series of banknotes – the Europa series – is even more secure and is helping to maintain public trust in the currency.

The Governing Council decided to reconfirm its very accommodative monetary policy stance.
First, the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.
Second, the Governing Council will continue the purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,850 billion. The Governing Council will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of March 2022 and, in any case, until it judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. The purchases under the PEPP will be conducted to preserve favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.
The Governing Council will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.
Third, net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. The Governing Council continues to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.
The Governing Council also intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.
Finally, the Governing Council will continue to provide ample liquidity through its refinancing operations. In particular, the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households.
The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today."

Credit standards tightened for loans to enterprises and households
Firms’ demand for loans continued to decline, while demand for housing loans increased
Government guarantees on loans to firms supported bank lending conditions
Credit standards – i.e. banks’ internal guidelines or loan approval criteria – tightened across all loan categories, namely loans to enterprises, loans to households for house purchase and consumer credit and other lending to households in the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the January 2021 bank lending survey (BLS). The net percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards for loans or credit lines to firms (net percentage of banks at 25%, see Chart 1) was somewhat higher than in the previous round. Credit standards for loans to households also tightened (a net percentage of 7% for loans to households for house purchase and 3% for consumer credit and other lending to households), but at a slower pace than in the previous quarters of 2020. Banks referred to the deterioration of the general economic outlook, increased credit risk of borrowers and a lower risk tolerance as relevant factors for the tightening of their credit standards for loans to firms and households. In the first quarter of 2021, banks expect credit standards to continue to tighten for loans to firms and households.
Banks’ overall terms and conditions – i.e. the actual terms and conditions agreed in loan contracts –tightened in the fourth quarter of 2020 for new loans to enterprises, with more stringent collateral requirements and wider loan margins, especially for riskier loans. For loans to households for house purchase, banks’ overall terms and conditions also tightened in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Firms’ demand for loans or drawing of credit lines declined further in net terms in the fourth quarter of 2020, with a larger percentage of banks indicating a decline than an increase in firms’ loan demand. Demand for inventories and working capital continued to contribute to an increase in demand, although its positive contribution was lower than in the first half of 2020. This might be explained by the precautionary liquidity buffers built up in previous quarters. Demand for loans for fixed investment declined for the fourth consecutive quarter (see Chart 2). Net demand for housing loans continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting a catching-up in demand after the first lockdown period in the second quarter. For consumer credit and other lending to households a net percentage of banks reported a decline in demand, following a moderate increase in the previous quarter. Net demand for housing loans and consumer credit was supported by the low general level of interest rates, while lower consumer confidence continued to dampen demand. In the first quarter of 2021, banks expect net demand for loans to firms and for consumer credit to increase, while net demand for housing loans is expected to decline.
Euro area banks indicated that regulatory or supervisory action continued to strengthen banks’ capital position and had a strong easing impact on their funding conditions in 2020. Banks also reported that supervisory or regulatory action continued to have a net tightening impact on their credit standards across all loan categories.
Euro area banks reported that non-performing loans (NPLs) had a tightening impact on credit standards and on terms and conditions for loans to enterprises and consumer credit in the second half of 2020 (and a broadly neutral impact for housing loans). Risk perceptions and risk aversion were the main drivers of the tightening impact of NPL ratios.
Looking at a sectoral breakdown, respondent banks indicated a net tightening of credit standards for loans to enterprises across all main sectors of economic activities in the second half of 2020. The net tightening was most pronounced for loans to firms in the commercial real estate and the wholesale and retail trade sectors.
Banks reported that coronavirus (COVID-19)-related government guarantees supported credit standards and helped keep terms and conditions for loans to firms more favourable in 2020. Banks also indicated a very strong net increase in demand for loans or credit lines with government guarantees in the first half of 2020, while the net increase in the second half was moderate, reflecting reduced liquidity needs.
The euro area bank lending survey, which is conducted four times a year, was developed by the Eurosystem in order to improve its understanding of banks’ lending behaviour in the euro area. The results reported in the January 2021 survey relate to changes observed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and expected changes in the first quarter of 2021, unless otherwise indicated. The January 2021 survey round was conducted between 4 and 29 December 2020. A total of 143 banks were surveyed in this round, with a response rate of 100%.

Over 8,000 responses received in online survey
Privacy, security and pan-European reach ranked highest in European citizens’ preferences
Detailed analysis to be published in spring, ahead of decision on project launch
The European Central Bank (ECB) concluded its public consultation on the digital euro yesterday and will now analyse in detail the large number of responses. 8,221 citizens, firms and industry associations submitted responses to an online questionnaire, a record for ECB public consultations.
The public consultation was launched on 12 October 2020, following the publication of the Eurosystem report on a digital euro. The ECB will publish a comprehensive analysis of the public consultation in the spring, which will serve as an important input for the ECB’s Governing Council when deciding whether to launch a digital euro project.
An initial analysis of raw data shows that privacy of payments ranked highest among the requested features of a potential digital euro (41% of replies), followed by security (17%) and pan-European reach (10%).
“The high number of responses to our survey shows the great interest of Europe’s citizens and firms in shaping the vision of a digital euro,” said Fabio Panetta, Member of the ECB’s Executive Board and Chair of the task force on a digital euro. “The opinions of citizens, businesses and all stakeholders are of utmost importance for us as we assess which use cases a digital euro might best serve.”
The Eurosystem task force, bringing together experts from the ECB and 19 national central banks of the euro area, identified possible scenarios that would require the issuance of a digital euro. These scenarios include an increased demand for electronic payments in the euro area that would require a European risk-free digital means of payment, a significant decline in the use of cash as a means of payment in the euro area, the launch of global private means of payment that might raise regulatory concerns and pose risks for financial stability and consumer protection, and a broad take-up of central bank digital currencies issued by other central banks.
A digital euro would be an electronic form of central bank money accessible to all citizens and firms – like banknotes, but in a digital form – to make their daily payments in a fast, easy and secure way. It would complement cash, not replace it. The Eurosystem will continue to issue cash in any case.
A digital euro would combine the efficiency of a digital payment instrument with the safety of central bank money. The protection of privacy would be a key priority, so that the digital euro can help maintain trust in payments in the digital age.

15 December 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.0%, 4.0% and 2.0%, respectively."
2 December 1999,"In the minimum reserve system of the Eurosystem, the liabilities which a credit institution owes to other institutions subject to this system (the ""interbank liabilities"") are excluded from the reserve base. The general criterion for the application of this provision is that credit institutions have to provide evidence of their interbank liabilities. However, if a credit institution cannot provide evidence of its interbank liabilities in the form of debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years or money market paper, the European Central Bank (ECB) allows the institution to apply a standardised deduction to the aforementioned liabilities (see Article 3.2 of the Regulation (EC) No. 2818/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves (ECB/1998/15)).
At its meeting on 2 December 1999 the Governing Council of the ECB decided, after a review of new statistical evidence available, to increase from 10% to 30% the standardised deduction from the reserve base to be applied to debt securities issued with an agreed maturity of up to two years and money market paper. This decision shall have effect as from the determination of the reserve requirement to be fulfilled in the maintenance period starting on 24 January 2000."
2 December 1999,"At its meeting on 2 December 1999 the Governing Council decided to confirm the reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the components underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December 1998, namely the Eurosystem's definition of price stability and the assumptions for trend real GDP growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity, have remained unchanged.
As before, the Governing Council will assess monetary developments in relation to the reference value on the basis of a three-month moving average of annual growth rates. The Governing Council has decided henceforth to review the reference value on a regular annual basis, with the next review to take place in December 2000.
Against this background, the Governing Council wishes to emphasise that the trend growth potential of the euro area could be considerably enhanced by structural reform in the labour and goods markets. The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy would take such changes into account, as appropriate.
The derivation of the reference value of 4½% is an expression of a medium-term-oriented approach. The generous liquidity situation in 1999 will have to be borne in mind.
In the context of the review of the reference value, the Governing Council wishes to recall the following features of the reference value and its role in the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem:"

The first version of the book was published by the European Monetary Institute (forerunner to the ECB) on 30 January 1998. The book contains individual country descriptions of collection systems and information relating to the methodologies used in the EU Member States.

18 November 1999,"At today's meeting (which was held in the form of a teleconference), the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 3.0%, 4.0% and 2.0%, respectively."
16 November 1999,"Today the European Central Bank (ECB) has published a report presenting the results of a survey on the cross-border payment service offered by TARGET, as perceived by its users. Input for this report was obtained by means of a questionnaire addressed to the Banking Federation of the European Union (FBE), the European Group of Co-operative Banks, the European Group of Savings Banks, the Heathrow Group and the national TARGET User Groups. The report is also based on feedback from individual institutions collected during meetings and seminars as well as on the monitoring of the system by the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB.
The survey indicates that TARGET is recognised as the de facto standard for making large-value cross-border payments in euro. Banks perceive TARGET not as a central bank utility which they are obliged to use, but as a service offered to them which can add value and reduce the risks involved in their operations. Nevertheless, banks have indicated some existing shortfalls, such as technical availability and harmonisation of the end-to-end service provided by TARGET, and expect further improvements in these areas. With regard to these issues, the report also presents the views of the Eurosystem and highlights those measures which are currently being implemented or considered.
In order to ensure that TARGET meets future market needs, the Eurosystem will continue to seek input from TARGET User Groups and, more generally, from the banking and financial community.
The report will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It can also be accessed via the ECB's Web site (pdf 292 kB), and copies are available from the ECB at the following address:"
15 November 1999,"The European Central Bank has today published the second edition of the ""Money and Banking Statistics Sector Manual - Guidance for the statistical classification of customers"" (generally referred to as the ""Sector Manual"").
The aim of the Sector Manual is to assist Monetary Financial Institutions (MFIs) in the classification by sector of their non-MFI counterparties located in other euro area Member States and in the other EU Member States in accordance with the requirements which are set out in the ECB Regulation of 1 December 1998 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (ECB/1998/16) and largely based on the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). The first edition of the Sector Manual was published by the European Monetary Institute in April 1998. The main changes in the second edition relate to the start of Monetary Union and, in particular, to the incorporation of details linked with the composition of the euro area. In addition, the recent implementation of ESA 95 in the domestic sectorisation has resulted in changes to the country-by-country explanatory notes and definitions.
Copies of the Sector Manual will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. They will also be available from the ECB - address please see below. The Sector Manual is available on the ECB's Web site [pdf 862 kB]."

Helsinki, 12 November 1999
A high level ""Seminar on the Accession Process"", took place on 11 and 12 November 1999 in Helsinki, gathering the Eurosystem (the ECB and the central banks of the 11 euro area countries) and the governors of the central banks of the 12 EU accession countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia). The Seminar was jointly organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and Suomen Pankki, the Finnish central bank. It was the first event of this kind. A second seminar will be held in Vienna next year.
The objective of the Seminar was to make a complete review of the central banking issues involved in the accession process, to identify the main problem areas and to enhance co-operation between the Eurosystem and central banks of candidate countries.
Against this background, a number of issues were discussed, in relation with the process of accession to the European Union and the different steps following on from accession (entry of the currencies into ERM II, prospective adoption of the euro).
The following key points emerged from the discussion:"
9 November 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) today published its ""Report on the legal protection of banknotes in the EU Member States"" [pdf 430 kB]. The Report is intended as a contribution to the preparation of the legal framework for the protection of euro banknotes within the EU Member States.
The Report covers various aspects of the legal regime for the protection of euro banknotes. These include counterfeiting; copyright protection; anti-copying devices for reproduction equipment;; the adoption and publication of euro banknote designs; the exchange of damaged or worn euro banknotes; the withdrawal of euro banknotes; the issuance of banknotes by entities other than the ECB and the National Central Banks (NCBs) and issuance of non-legal tender banknotes, the so-called ""fancy"" banknotes.
The major conclusions of the Report can be summarised as follows:"
4 November 1999,"The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has selected Publicis as the agency which will assist in conducting an information campaign in preparation for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002.

4 November 1999,At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:
3 November 1999,"The second December meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB has been rescheduled. The meeting was brought forward from Thursday, 16 December 1999 to Wednesday, 15 December 1999 in order to enable several Governing Council members to attend a first gathering of a new forum grouping Ministers and Central Bank Governors (the so-called G20), to be held on 16 December 1999 in Berlin.
[Please refer to the following overview for details of the meetings and press conferences scheduled to be held in the remainder of 1999 and in the year 2000]."
21 October 1999,At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following decisions:
15 October 1999,"In the first year following the establishment of the European Central Bank (ECB), the decision-making bodies of the ECB adopted a series of ECB legal instruments which have been published on a case-by-case basis in the Official Journal of the European Communities. In order to facilitate access to and use of these legal texts by interested members of the public, the ECB has created a legal yearbook, entitled ""Compendium"", the first issue of which contains all public ECB legal instruments adopted between June 1998 and May 1999.
The ""Compendium"" is available in all 11 official Community languages and will be distributed by each of the EU national central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. The ""Compendium"" is also available from the ECB in whichever of the 11 languages is requested, and may be obtained by sending a written request either by fax (0049 69 1344 7404) or by e-mail (info@ecb.int) to the ECB's Press Division. As of November 1999 it can be accessed via the ECB's Web site."
15 October 1999,"In application of Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2532/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions, at its meeting on 23 September 1999 the Governing Council adopted the ECB Regulation on the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions (ECB/1999/4). This Regulation will enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The date of publication was 12 October 1999.
By further specifying the procedures established by the aforementioned Council Regulation whereby sanctions may be imposed by the European Central Bank, the ECB Regulation aims at ensuring a uniform approach towards the imposition of sanctions in the various fields of competence of the ECB . The ECB Regulation also responds to the general principles of legal certainty and transparency, whereby market participants should be informed of the detailed provisions which the ECB may deem necessary to adopt for the imposition of sanctions. Furthermore, the provisions of the ECB Regulation aim to ensure a high degree of protection for the rights of defence of the undertakings concerned, in line with the latest case law of the European Court of Justice.
Apart from specifying the procedural steps laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No. 2532/98, the ECB Regulation , in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank, introduces in its Article 11 a specific swift procedure which will apply in cases of failure by an institution to hold all or part of the minimum reserves imposed in accordance with this Council Regulation on minimum reserves or with ECB Regulations or ECB Decisions associated with it. Finally, the ECB Regulation also includes, in its Article 10, a simplified procedure for imposing sanctions of a lesser amount."
7 October 1999,"At its meeting on 20 May 1999 the Governing Council of the ECB approved and published a list of links between securities settlement systems which can be used for the transfer of foreign collateral in the Eurosystem's monetary policy and intraday credit operations. On that occasion the Governing Council expressed its intention to publish regularly a list of links which comply with the ECB standards.
At its meeting on 7 October 1999 the Governing Council of the ECB approved a further 21 links between securities settlement systems. Of these 21 links, six are operated by intermediaries. These intermediaries, acting as agents, do not have any interest in or any claim on the securities holdings of the investor securities settlement system.
With the approval of these links, the number of links which are currently eligible for used increased from 26 to 47 (see the attached table)."
7 October 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. today."
7 October 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) shares the concerns of the European Parliament, the EU Council and the Commission of the European Communities about the need to combat fraud and other activities detrimental to the financial interests of the Communities and the ECB.
Against this background and for the sake of transparency, efficiency and accountability, the Governing Council of the ECB has adopted a Decision according to which an independent Anti-Fraud Committee will be established to enforce an anti-fraud scheme within the ECB. The Committee will be composed of three independent persons of recognised standing and professional experience in the fields of central banking, justice and policing, and fraud prevention and detection. Within the ECB, the Directorate Internal Audit is entrusted with the task of conducting all investigations relating to fraud prevention and detection. For the purpose of combating fraud, the Director of Internal Audit will report to the Anti-Fraud Committee.
In response to the conclusions of the Cologne European Council in June 1999, a co-operative relationship will be established with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
The text of the Decision of the ECB will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities."
27 September 1999,"On Saturday, 25 September 1999, the Trans-European Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System (TARGET) demonstrated its year 2000 compliance in a general testing of a full business day in a simulated year 2000 environment. Several hundreds of credit institutions, all fifteen national RTGS systems and the payment system of the ECB were involved in this test.
TARGET is a decentralised system connecting the national real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems via an interlinking infrastructure and is mainly used for large value cross-border transfers.
Systems opened at 11 a.m. with the business date 3rd January 2000 and processed cross-border customer and interbank payments, which were sent and received by the participating credit institutions. Settlement of ancillary systems, which opened specifically for this TARGET demonstration, was completed successfully. For example, the Euro 1 system of the Euro Banking Association (EBA) conducted a settlement cycle involving several member banks. No year 2000 related problems were detected.
A technical problem in one country which was not related to Y2K testing prevented this country from actively participating in the test. This country, however, had already proven its Year 2000 compliance during previous TARGET Year 2000 testing activities and also in the Global Year 2000 test organised by the New York Clearing House on 12th and 13th June 1999.
The successful demonstration of 25th September 1999 completes several TARGET test cycles, which started with the examination of the basic components and went systematically through all layers of the system, covering in addition to the move from 1999 to 2000 also the leap year issue in 2000. TARGET will enter now a moratorium period from 1st October 1999 until 1st March 2000, where in general no changes to the systems should be done. In case of ""emergency changes"" to the existing systems, strict risk evaluation and re-testing criteria will be applied.
In parallel to the testing activities, contingency procedures have been reconsidered and tested, and a detailed action plan for the transition to the year 2000 is being prepared."

In the interest of clarifying their intentions with respect to their gold holdings, the undersigned institutions make the following statement:"
23 September 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is today releasing to the public the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's tender operations in 2000 [annex, pdf 26 kB].
The indicative calendar is prepared in compliance with the procedures set out in the ""General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (dated September 1998). The ECB aims at establishing conditions ensuring that counterparties in all Member States can participate in the main and the longer-term refinancing operations. Therefore, when compiling the calendar for these operations, the ECB has made appropriate adjustments to take into account bank holidays in the individual Member States.
Attention should be drawn to one particular aspect of the indicative calendar relating to the transition to the year 2000. As already pointed out in a previous press release, the ECB is convinced that the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework is flexible enough and has built-in mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand that might arise in the euro markets. In addition different scenarios have been analysed and the conclusion has consistently emerged that the Eurosystem will be in a position to cope with any potential increase in the demand for liquidity: the stock of banknotes held by national central banks is sufficient to allow for a considerable additional demand for banknotes in circulation and the amount of collateral available in the Eurosystem will be sufficient to allow for the corresponding increase of refinancing needs of the banking system. Nonetheless, it is considered prudent to eliminate any potential problem that may derive from the maturing and renewal of a main refinancing operation in the first week of the year 2000. Thus, no new main refinancing operation will be initiated in the first week of the year 2000, and no such operation will mature during this week. In fact the maturity of the main refinancing operation of 21 December 1999 will be lengthened exceptionally to three weeks. To avoid that two main refinancing operations mature on 12 January 2000, the operation of 30 December 1999 will also be lengthened to three weeks. This adaptation, which is consistent with the overall set-up, is considered useful to minimise any potential problem for counterparties and for the financial market, which could result from the conduct and settlement of a large operation directly after the transition to the new century."
23 September 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively."
13 September 1999,"Efficient cross-border retail payment services are essential for the smooth functioning of the Single Market. Citizens and businesses can only benefit fully from the fundamental principles of the free movement of goods, services, capital and people if they are also able to transfer money as rapidly, reliably and cheaply from one part of the European Union to another as is now the case within each Member State.
The introduction of the euro is an important contribution to the completion of the Single Market. It facilitates cross-border trade and should make it possible for producers and consumers to reap the benefits associated therewith. Despite the introduction of the euro, however, there is still a clear gap between the service levels of domestic and cross-border retail payment systems in terms of quality, efficiency and pricing. The substantial disparities between domestic and cross-border services ought now to be reduced, and should ultimately disappear. Indeed, the single currency environment argues strongly in favour of a single payment area.
In this respect, important improvements in the practices of banks should result from the implementation, in August 1999, of the European Parliament and Council Directive No. 97/5/EC of 27 January 1997 on cross-border credit transfers, which establishes rules in the area of the transparency and performance of cross-border payments.
Since the Directive applies to the whole of the European Union, its scope is limited to addressing certain specific aspects of cross-border credit transfers within a multi-currency environment. Therefore, the implementation of the Directive may not be sufficient to respond to all the requirements of an efficient Single Market for payment systems and to the needs and expectations of users with regard to payments within the single currency area.
In order to encourage the development of cross-border payment systems enabling the public to benefit more fully from the single currency, the Eurosystem, in line with its basic task of promoting the smooth functioning of payment systems, as laid down in Article 105 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 3 of the Statute of the ESCB, has drawn up the following objectives for cross-border retail payments in the euro area. The Eurosystem calls on the banking and payment service industry to fulfil these objectives by 1 January 2002 at the latest. These objectives have been set in order to help to strike a balance between what is expected by users of payment services and what is achievable in the short run. In order to take up this challenge, the ECB and the national central banks are open to discussion on possible solutions and to co-operation with the industry, in order that these objectives may be achieved.
Objective 1:
Enhanced system(s)/services to be ready by 1 January 2002
When the euro banknotes and coins are introduced on 1 January 2002, the citizens of Europe will be able to use the same currency denomination in all the countries of the euro area. They also expect to benefit, by then, from efficient, cheap and user-friendly cross-border payment systems. For the banking community to meet that expectation, measures to substantially improve the efficiency and performance of cross-border retail payments should be in place before January 2002.
Objective 2:
Priority should be given to cross-border credit transfers
The banking and payment service industry has already made significant efforts in developing cross-border systems, in particular in the field of card payments, which allow for an efficient execution of ""face-to-face"" payments. The industry is invited to continue its efforts in this respect and to extend them to other payment instruments which also require efficient remote servicing. As credit transfers appear to be an important vehicle for cross-border retail payments, and an area in which there is scope for substantial improvement, priority should be given to this particular instrument.
Objective 3:
The price of cross-border credit transfers should decrease substantially
The final price of credit transfers will be determined by banks, acting in a competitive environment. Without prejudice to fair remuneration for the service provided, it should be possible to achieve a substantial reduction in fees. As a short-term objective, the domestic processing component of cross-border transfers should be priced at the same level as for national ones, insofar as they comply with domestic standards and procedures and can thus be processed together with domestic payments.
Objective 4:
Settlement time should be comparable for domestic and cross-border payments
Cross-border retail credit transfers should be processed as quickly as payments made within the domestic environment. The end-to-end execution of cross-border payment orders should not take more than one day longer than the time needed for domestic payments.
Objective 5:
Unless otherwise agreed in advance, fees for cross -border credit transfers should be borne by the originator of the payment only
The Directive on cross-border credit transfers states that customers should be informed in advance of all costs relating to transactions. When the sending and the receiving credit institution have a well-established business relationship, it should be possible to meet this requirement. Where this is not the case, and in order to assist the banks in fulfilling this price-transparency requirement, only the originator of the payment should be charged, with no costs being borne by the beneficiary. This default practice would also be in line with prevailing current practices for domestic credit transfers and hence contribute to the creation of a single euro payment area and to the achievement of full cost transparency, as required by the Directive.
Objective 6:
Access to cross-border retail payment systems should be open
To avoid additional costs and an extended payment execution time linked to the involvement of many intermediaries, the criteria for access to systems should be public, objective, fair and non-discriminatory.
Objective 7:
Existing standards should be implemented as soon as possible.
Standardisation is a key element in increasing the efficiency of cross-border retail payments. Banks should speed up the implementation of the standards already defined by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS). The Eurosystem stands ready to play a co-ordinating and supportive role with the aim of facilitating the actual implementation of such standards.
The full report, entitled ""Improving cross-border retail payment services in the euro area - the Eurosystem's view"", will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It can be accessed via the ECB's Web site (section: other publications). Copies are also available from the ECB at the following address:"
13 September 1999,"The national central banks and the ECB agreed on a new fee structure for the correspondent central banking model (CCBM). After having gained more experience with the use of the CCBM and the costs incurred by the national central banks and the ECB in running the CCBM, the fee has been revised with the primary aim of recovering the costs of the correspondent central bank, which is holding the collateral on behalf of the home central bank, the national central bank that is granting the credit to the counterparty.
The current fee of EUR 5 per CCBM transaction will be replaced therefore by a multiple fee composed of a transaction fee of EUR 30 per transaction and a combined custody and administration fee of 0.0069% per annum. The combined custody and administration fee will be based on the amount of collateral which has been delivered via the CCBM. The home central bank will charge the new fees to its counterparties and pass the revenue on to the correspondent central bank. The home central bank can continue to ask for additional fees to cover its own costs incurred in running the CCBM.
The new fees will come into force on 1 October 1999 which should give sufficient time to adapt the local administrative and legal procedures.
The national central banks will inform their counterparties in due course about the details of the calculation method to be applied.
In addition, statistical information about the cross-border use of collateral for the ESCB's monetary policy and intraday credit operations is now also available at the ECB's Internet website."
9 September 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively.

31 August 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is today releasing to the public a report entitled ""Payment systems in countries that have applied for membership of the European Union"". The publication has been prepared in co-operation with the central banks of Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. It provides comprehensive information on the major payment and securities settlement systems operating in the applicant countries.
The availability of information on these systems is of utmost importance for central banks as well as for market participants. Every central bank has a direct interest in the efficiency and prudent design and management of any payment and securities settlement system operating in its own currency. The smooth functioning of these systems is of great importance for the functioning of the financial markets and is crucial to the maintenance of banking and financial stability. Market participants must know how the payment infrastructure works in order to be able truly to address efficiency issues and the management of operational and settlement risks. For European Union (EU) countries, this kind of information has been made available in the report entitled ""Payment systems in the European Union"", also known as the ""Blue Book"", the second edition of which was published by the European Monetary Institute in April 1996.
To facilitate an easy comparison of the systems operating in countries that have applied for EU membership with those existing in the current EU Member States, the publication has been structured in a similar way to the Blue Book of 1996. Each country chapter provides an overview of institutional aspects and the major parties involved, and there are extensive descriptions of the payment media used by non-banks, retail payment systems, interbank exchange and settlement systems, and securities settlement systems. The statistical tables provide country-specific data for the years 1993 to 1997, while the comparative tables covering all 11 countries are based on figures for 1996 and 1997.
The information provided shows that extensive restructuring work in payment and securities settlement systems has been undertaken in recent years in the applicant countries and that in many countries further work is being undertaken to ensure a smooth entry into and operation within the European Union environment.
Within the field of payment systems, the publication of this report marks an important milestone in the deepening of co-operation with the central banks of countries that have applied for EU membership.
The report will be distributed by each of the EU and applicant country national central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It can be accessed via the ECB's Web site (http://www.ecb.europa.eu). Copies are also available from the ECB at the following address:"

Mr Grisse held various positions at the Deutsche Bundesbank, as Head of the Bundesbank's Division for International and IMF-Relations, Head of the Foreign Department with responsibilities for managing Germany's foreign reserves and, at present, Head of the Personnel Department."
26 August 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively."
11 August 1999,"The Eurosystem, which maintains close contact with the banking and financial community in the euro area, is well prepared for the transition to the Year 2000. Indeed, its operational framework was, from the outset, designed with a view to ensuring maximum flexibility in the implementation of monetary policy. Hence, unlike some of the systems used by other central banks, the Eurosystem's operational framework already has built-in mechanisms designed to deal with any level of liquidity demand from market participants.
In particular, its standing facilities offer an automatic channel to counter any potential fluctuation in the liquidity needed by the banking system, and thus also to limit any impact of these fluctuations on short-term interest rates. In addition, the three following characteristics of the monetary policy framework are worth highlighting in this context: first, the Eurosystem has at its disposal a diverse range of instruments that may, if necessary, complement its main and longer-term refinancing operations and its standing facilities. Second, the eligibility criteria for collateral required for the refinancing operations of the Eurosystem and the correspondent central banking model (which allows the cross-border use of collateral) ensure that there is a sufficient amount of eligible assets available as collateral even under rather exceptional circumstances. Finally, the averaging mechanism applied to the one-month maintenance period of the reserve requirement system generally contributes to smoothing out temporary liquidity flows.
The European Central Bank sees no need for the public to hold excess cash for the transition to the Year 2000. Nevertheless, the Eurosystem is well prepared to meet any liquidity requirements resulting from an increase in the demand for banknotes, should the need arise."

15 July 1999,"The production of euro banknotes has started. Printing works in the following countries have started or will start production in July: Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. In accordance with the overall planning, production will start at the other printing works over the next few months. The later start of production at some printing works is due either to the volume of euro banknotes they need to print, or to their production planning for national banknotes still to be printed. For further information on the printing works involved please see the attached map - Annex 1.
Each national central bank has been responsible for deciding where to print the initial supply of the euro banknotes required in its country.
The euro banknotes and coins will be put into circulation on 1 January 2002. There are therefore 900 calendar days until their launch. By 1 January 2002, around 13 billion euro banknotes will have to be printed for the 11 participating countries: 9 billion banknotes to replace national banknotes and 4 billion banknotes as logistical stocks. For further information please see the attached table - Annex 2. These banknotes represent a value of some EUR 600 billion. The estimates of the number of euro banknotes to be printed before the launch will be updated annually, in order to take account of possible changes in the demand for these banknotes.
The start of production follows several successful preparatory steps: approval of the designs and the technical specifications, clearance of the proofs, printing of the pilot series and the setting up of a quality management system.
A press folder containing this press release, background information on the production of euro coins (prepared in collaboration with the European Commission), TV footage, two photographs and a brochure on the euro banknotes and coins is available from the Press Offices of the European Central Bank and the national central banks."
15 July 1999,"1. Current state of the euro coin production
About 56 billion euro coins will be produced to replace the national currency coins in the 11 countries of the euro zone. These represent a total weight of about 250,000 tons. Each Member State is responsible for the coins it will put into circulation. Production of euro coins started in May 1998 and is now under way in most euro zone Mints. By the end of May 1999 about 8% of the required volume of euro coins had been produced. Production is proceeding according to schedule."
15 July 1999,"With regard to the calendar of TARGET operating days for 1999, it was announced by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) on 31 March 1999 that TARGET would close on 31 December 1999, in addition to Saturdays and Sundays, Christmas Day (25 December) and New Year's Day. Closing TARGET on 31 December 1999 will enhance the safety of the transition to the year 2000.
The experience gained during the first six months of 1999 shows that all TARGET operating days were considered to be value dates for financial market contracts in euro. As a result, payment traffic was not negligible on days such as Good Friday and Easter Monday, when cross-border traffic in TARGET reached two thirds and half of the normal volume respectively. However, considering the financial and social cost of keeping the TARGET system open on days which are traditionally public holidays (or bank holidays) in most of the euro area and also the indication given by the European banking industry that it would welcome the closing of TARGET on such days, the Governing Council has decided to implement the following regime for the year 2000:"
14 July 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) has today released the publication entitled ""Euro Area Monetary Aggregates Conceptual Reconciliation Exercise"".
This publication presents some selected results of a conceptual reconciliation exercise carried out during 1998. The aim of this exercise was to identify the links between the categories of financial instruments included before the start of Monetary Union in the national monetary aggregates of the Member States now participating in the euro area and the current harmonised categories in the balance sheet statistics of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector.

1 July 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) published a tender notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 12 February 1999 regarding a contract to prepare and execute a Europe-wide information campaign for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002. On the basis of the resulting applications, nine companies were invited to make a presentation at the ECB.
The following three companies were shortlisted to participate in the final stage of the competition:"

24 June 1999,"The bilateral Year 2000 compliance tests of ESCB-wide systems were successfully completed on 19 June 1999. The outcome of these tests marks a significant step forward in establishing the overall compliance status of the ESCB. Taking into account the result of these tests, on Thursday, 24 June 1999 at 12 p.m. the text on
""Activities to ensure Year 2000 compliance of IT systems in use at the European Central Bank and at the European System of Central Banks""
published on the ECB Web site will be updated.
At the same time, the ECB will add to its Web site a text on
""TARGET Year 2000 preparations"".
This text is intended to inform interested parties of the internal IT and business functionality tests which are being conducted under the responsibility of each individual institution connected to TARGET. In addition, it reports on the multilateral business functionality tests of the TARGET system as a whole."
17 June 1999,"The Governing Council has agreed that in the year 2000 its meetings shall continue to be held, as a rule, on alternate Thursdays. As in 1999, exceptions to this rule are envisaged in order to accommodate special holiday situations, namely with regard to Epiphany, Corpus Christi, the summer holiday and the New Year. It has also been agreed that, beginning in 2000, two scheduled meetings each year will be held in a venue outside Germany, but within the euro area. The schedule for the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB in 2000 is as follows:
5 January 2000 (Wednesday)

17 June 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively."
2 June 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) will today launch the publication of a Working Paper Series. The Working Paper Series seeks to disseminate the results of research conducted within the ECB to the broad academic and financial market communities. Issues that are relevant to the concerns of the Eurosystem determine the subject matter addressed in this Series.
The following is a list of the papers that comprise the initial publication:"
2 June 1999,"At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5%, respectively.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2 p.m. today."
28 May 1999,"At its meeting on 20 May 1999, the ECB's Governing Council approved a list of links between securities settlement systems (SSSs) that can be used for the transfer of foreign collateral in the Eurosystem's monetary policy and intraday credit operations. Furthermore, the Governing Council updated the operational conditions for the use of eligible SSSs in the settlement of collateral used in Eurosystem credit operations."
20 May 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively.
In addition, the Governing Council decided to change the maturity of the longer-term refinancing scheduled to be settled on 30 September 1999. The redemption date of this operation will be brought forward from 30 December to 23 December 1999. Related to this, the longer-term refinancing operation, originally scheduled to be announced on 27 December 1999 and to be allotted and settled on 30 December 1999, will instead be announced on 21 December, allotted on 22 December and settled on 23 December 1999. This rescheduling of operations is intended to alleviate the working procedures for the financial market participants at the turn of the year."
6 May 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.5%, 3.5% and 1.5% respectively.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2 p.m. today."
22 April 1999,"At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB took the following decisions:"
21 April 1999,"In December 1998 the European Central Bank (ECB) released a brochure entitled ""Correspondent central banking model (CCBM)"" describing the main features of the model that the Eurosystem is using for the cross-border use of collateral in its credit operations.
An updated version of the brochure is now available on the ECB Web site (http://www.ecb.europa.eu). This new brochure, in addition to the general presentation of the main features of the correspondent central banking model, includes further information on national procedures, which will prove helpful to counterparties in using the model. In particular, a table summarising the main technical and operational features of domestic securities settlement systems has been added.
Copies of the brochure are also available from the ECB at the following address:"
8 April 1999,At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB took the following monetary policy decisions:
31 March 1999,"The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided that, in view of the Year 2000 changeover, the TARGET system will be closed on 31 December 1999. The closing of TARGET includes both the Interlinking mechanism and all domestic euro RTGS systems participating in or connected to TARGET.
The Governing Council of the ECB is of the opinion that general preparatory work for the Year 2000 should not only cover testing activities, but should also include the adoption of preventive and supportive measures to avoid possible disruptions. In this respect, the closing of TARGET on 31 December 1999 will enhance the safety of the transition to the Year 2000, since it allows all end-of-day and end-of-year activities for all systems to be carried out and all backups of data to be finalised before midnight on that day.
The Governing Council is convinced that an early decision on this issue was necessary in order to give market participants time to adapt to this change in the calendar of TARGET operating days for 1999."
18 March 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the latest information on the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment that the prospects for price stability remain favourable. Therefore, it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 24 and 31 March and 7 April 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the main refinancing operations already settled this year, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 2.0%."
4 March 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council reviewed the latest monetary, financial and economic developments. Taking into account all the information available, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. Against this background it decided that for the main refinancing operations to be settled on 10 and 17 March 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the previous ones, i.e. they will be conducted as fixed rate tenders at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 2.0%.
The Governing Council also decided today that for forthcoming longer-term refinancing operations of the Eurosystem the multiple rate method of allotment will be applied starting from the next such operation (which is to be settled on 25 March 1999) until otherwise indicated."
23 February 1999,"His Royal Highness Don Felipe de Borbón visited the European Central Bank on Tuesday, 23 February 1999. He was welcomed by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, and met the Executive Board and the Management of the ECB, with whom he exchanged views on current issues. He also met the Spanish members of staff."
18 February 1999,"At today's meeting the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment that the prospects for price stability remain favourable and that no strong pressures - either upward or downward - can be identified. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two main refinancing operations to be settled on 24 February and 3 March 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the main refinancing operations already settled this year, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. In addition, the interest rate on the marginal lending facility will continue to be 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility will remain 2.0%.
Furthermore, the Governing Council decided that the second longer-term refinancing operation, which will be settled on 25 February 1999, will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate allotment procedure. As already indicated, the ECB intends to allot an amount of EUR 15 billion in this tender."
11 February 1999,"The European Central Bank (ECB) is today releasing to the public an addendum, incorporating 1997 data, to the descriptive guide to the payment and securities settlement systems operating in the Member States of the European Union (EU), the so-called ""Blue Book"". The publication has been prepared by the ECB with the assistance of the EU central banks.
This ""Blue Book Addendum"" provides the third update of the country data and comparative tables given in the Blue Book published in April 1996. The data, where appropriate, are presented as time series in order to facilitate the analysis of recent developments.
The ""Blue Book Addendum"" will be distributed by each of the EU central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It will also be available from the ECB at the following address:"
9 February 1999,"In the context of the task of the Eurosystem (i.e. the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the Member States participating in Monetary Union) to contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system, as laid down in Article 105 (5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the ECB will release a report of the Banking Supervision Committee entitled ""Possible effects of EMU on the EU banking systems in the medium to long term"".The report addresses the structural impact that Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is likely to have on the EU banking systems in the medium and long term, as well as the way in which the EU banks are responding to the envisaged developments. It also provides relevant information on the features and structure of the EU banking systems.
The report has been prepared with input from the representatives of the EU banking supervisory authorities represented on the Banking Supervision Committee, chaired by Mr. Edgar Meister, who is a member of the Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The Committee assists the Eurosystem in promoting co-operation between the relevant authorities on issues relating to banking supervision and financial stability. The report also draws on interviews with representatives of selected banks conducted at the national level.
The main findings of the report - which can be regarded as being useful both to banks and to the public authorities responsible for maintaining financial stability - are summarised below.
First, Monetary Union is expected to have an impact on banking activities in various ways. The reduction in foreign exchange activity in the currencies replaced by the euro can be considered to be the immediate consequence. However, banks are likely to increase their money and especially securities market activities to even out lower revenues from foreign exchange trading. The introduction of the euro and the single monetary policy will favour the setting-up of deep and liquid integrated money and capital markets that will, in turn, generate growth, but also trigger further competition in this area. A reduction in government debt owing to fiscal consolidation under Monetary Union is likely to boost the spreading of other securities and, possibly, the securities activities of banks. Retail deposit business might be affected to the extent that the establishment of a low interest rate environment would induce customers to seek alternative investments to deposits. Lending business might benefit from the positive macroeconomic environment brought about by Monetary Union, but the expected further securitisation and disintermediation might operate in the reverse direction. Correspondent banking services are likely to decrease owing to the centralisation of treasury functions at large banks. All in all, Monetary Union will offer banks new business opportunities, and the ways in which these will be exploited will vary among banks, depending on their specific activities and strategic choices.
Second, Monetary Union is expected to act as a catalyst to the structural trends already under way in the EU banking systems as a result of other factors (such as financial liberalisation, disintermediation and technological change). In particular, these trends can be characterised as follows:"
8 February 1999,"The President of the European Central Bank has appointed Mr. Robert Raymond as the ECB's permanent representative in Washington D.C. with observer status at the International Monetary Fund. This appointment is effective as from 8 February 1999.
Mr. Raymond was Director General of the European Monetary Institute from January 1994 to May 1998. He was then appointed Senior Special Adviser to the Executive Board of the ECB for the period from June to December 1998.
Mr. Raymond will participate, with the status of observer, in all IMF Executive Board meetings related to the following issues:"
2 February 1999,"The differences in behaviour which emerged between the various national banking systems in their participation in the Eurosystem's Main Refinancing Operations have raised the question of the interpretation of the General Documentation regarding the collateral obligations of counterparties in the context of bidding in tender operations. Therefore the Eurosystem has clarified to its counterparties that the valid interpretation of the General Documentation allows tender bids not actually covered by collateral at the time of the submission of bids, and just requires the financial capacity to have the collateral on the date of settlement of the tender. The final settlement of the tender operation is subject to the availability of collateral sufficient to cover the allotted amount."
21 January 1999,"At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. Taking into account the latest economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two main refinancing operations to be settled on 27 January and 3 February 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the three main refinancing operations settled earlier this month, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%.
In addition, the Governing Council discussed the interest rates on its two standing facilities. It recalled that it had set the interest rate on the marginal lending facility at 4.5% and the interest rate on the deposit facility at 2% at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999. However, as a transitional measure the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate were set at a level of 3.25% and 2.75%, respectively, for the period from 4 to 21 January 1999. The purpose of the narrow corridor thus established by the interest rates on the standing facilities was to facilitate the transition by market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union.
At today's meeting, the Governing Council reviewed the experience with the functioning of the euro area-wide money market since the beginning of the year. It noted that difficulties of some market participants with the functioning of the area-wide money market and, in particular, with the cross-border flow of liquidity, have diminished substantially over time. As a consequence, overall, the integration of the euro area money market has therefore reached a satisfactory state only three weeks after its creation. Against this background, the Governing Council did not see a need for continuing the application of the narrow interest rate corridor beyond the date of 21 January 1999, noting that an extended use of a narrow corridor would be likely to hamper the development of an efficiently functioning money market in the euro area in the longer term. Thus, the Governing Council decided today to revert to the interest rates on the Eurosystem's two standing facilities which it had set for the start of Stage Three, i.e. it set the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at a level of 4.5% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2% with effect from 22 January 1999."
18 January 1999,The European Central Bank (ECB) will publish its first Monthly Bulletin this week. This ECB publication will become one of the main tools used to analyse economic developments in the euro area and to explain the monetary policy of the ECB. The statistical part of the Monthly Bulletin will develop into one of the key sources of euro area-wide statistics. This first issue of the Monthly Bulletin will include the following:
12 January 1999,"The second main refinancing operation
On 11 January 1999 the Eurosystem announced its second main refinancing operation, which was successfully completed today. The operation, which was conducted by means of reverse transactions at a fixed rate of 3%, has a duration of 14 days, from 13 to 27 January 1999. A total of 1068 banks participated in the operation and submitted bids to the national central banks for an amount of EUR 563 billion. The total amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system amounted to EUR 48 billion, thus resulting in an allotment quota of 8.52%.
The maturing on 13 January 1999 of approximately EUR 66 billion of liquidity-providing monetary policy operations that were conducted by national central banks in Stage Two of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) was taken into account by the Eurosystem when reaching the allotment decision. The fact that the maturing operations are only partially substituted by the second main refinancing operation takes also into account the volume to be allotted on 13 January 1999 in the first longer-term refinancing operations (see below).
The allotment decision was taken on the basis of an analysis of the liquidity conditions in the euro area as a whole, while paying due attention to the uncertainties connected with the phasing-in of the new system. The decision aims at allowing the credit institutions (on aggregate) to follow a smooth path in fulfilling their minimum reserve requirements over the first maintainance period which extends from 1 January 1999 to 23 February 1999.
It can be anticipated that, owing to the phasing-in of the Eurosystem's different refinancing operations, the daily aggregate current account holdings of credit institutions on 13 January 1999 will be below the daily average reserve holdings required to meet the estimated reserve requirement of the first maintenance period. The effect of this one daily shortfall in relation to the required daily average will be compensated by the additional liquidity provided through the first longer-term refinancing operation on 14 January 1999.
The definitive figure for the aggregate reserve requirement of credit institutions in the euro area will not become available until early February. In order to provide some guidance to the market, on 4 January 1999 the Eurosystem published its estimate of around EUR 100 billion for the aggregate reserve requirement for the first maintenance period. On the basis of the information currently available, it appears likely at present that the definitive figure might be slightly below this estimate, rather than above it.
The first longer-term refinancing operations
The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January 1999 and will be settled on 14 January 1999.
As specified in the ESCB publication entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"", dated September 1998, ""the longer-term refinancing operations are liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months. These operations aim to provide counterparties with additional longer-term refinancing and are executed by the national central banks on the basis of standard tenders. In these operations, the ESCB does not, as a rule, intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker."" The General Documentation also specifies that ""from time to time, the ECB indicates the operation volume to be allotted in forthcoming"" longer-term refinancing operations.
As announced by the Governing Council of the ECB on 22 December 1998, the first longer-term refinancing operations will be conducted by means of variable rate tenders, using the single rate (i.e. Dutch) auction procedure. The phasing-in of the longer-term refinancing operations requires the Eurosystem to conduct parallel tenders with three different maturities (25 February 1999, 25 March 1999 and 29 April 1999). The ECB intends to allot an amount of EUR 15 billion in each of the parallel tenders. The total amount that the ECB intends to allot in these three operations is thus EUR 45 billion. (This compares with EUR 25 billion of liquidity-providing operations conducted by national central banks in Stage Two which mature on the settlement day of this first longer-term refinancing operation.)
It should be noted that, in order to allow sufficient time in which to process these three parallel operations, the announcement of the tender results will take place at 1.15 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) on 13 January 1999, instead of at 11.15 a.m., which is the announcement time foreseen for the results of all other regular tender operations of the Eurosystem.
As regards the subsequent longer-term refinancing operations in the first three months of 1999, the amount the ECB intends to allot will also be EUR 15 billion per operation."
11 January 1999,"TARGET proved successful in its first week of operation, handling a larger number of payments than had been expected. Few technical problems were experienced and most of these had no business implications for the users of the system.
Most of the problems encountered stemmed from: 1) the high concentration of payment flows in the late hours of the day; and 2) difficulties experienced by several banks in adapting to the TARGET rules and creating TARGET-compliant messages. Therefore, at the end of each business day, a substantial number of payments remained unsettled. This led to higher than expected rates of payment rejection.
To give banks time to adjust to this new environment, the European System of Central Banks has decided that the final closing time of the TARGET system will be temporarily extended until 7 p.m., CET, from 11 January to 29 January inclusive. The cut-off time for customer payments will continue to be 5 p.m.
This extended service window should only be used by banks which experience difficulties in settling their last payments before the normal closing time of 6 p.m. It should not be considered as an extension of the normal TARGET hours of operation. Consequently, any use of the extended service window will result in an additional charge of EUR 15 per cross-border payment.
Moreover, access to the deposit facility of the Eurosystem will be available during this period for one hour (instead of 30 minutes) after the closure of the TARGET system.
There is no intention to extend this facility beyond the end of January 1999. In the longer run, the smooth operation of TARGET will depend on banks respecting the following recommendations."
7 January 1999,"At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB reviewed the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area against the background of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. Taking into account the latest economic developments, the Governing Council confirmed its earlier assessment of the outlook for price stability. The Governing Council therefore decided that for the two main refinancing operations to be announced on 11 January 1999 and 18 January 1999 the same conditions will apply as for the first such operation, which was settled today, i.e. they will be fixed rate tenders conducted at an interest rate of 3.0%. The Governing Council confirmed its intention to maintain the main refinancing rate at this level for the foreseeable future.
In addition, the Governing Council recalled that the marginal lending rate and the deposit rate were set at levels of 3.25% and 2.75%, respectively, for the period from 4 to 21 January 1999. The Governing Council confirmed its intention to terminate this transitional measure following its next meeting on 21 January 1999.
Finally, the Governing Council recalled the decision taken at its meeting on 22 December 1998 that the first longer-term refinancing operation, which will be announced on 12 January 1999 and settled on 14 January 1999, will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate allotment procedure."
5 January 1999,"According to Article 15.2 of the Statute of the ESCB, a consolidated financial statement of the ESCB shall be published each week. The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided that the reporting day for this weekly financial statement shall be Friday, and that publication will take place on the following Tuesday. The first weekly financial statement of the ESCB in the composition of the Eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the national central banks of the 11 EU Member States participating in Stage Three of EMU from the start) will therefore be drawn up for the reporting date 8 January 1999
[

]
The weekly financial statement contains the assets and liabilities held by the Eurosystem vis-à-vis third parties as they arise in the accounts of the 11 euro area national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB. An overview of the definitions of the individual items is annexed to this press release. It should be noted that claims and liabilities between the NCBs and the ECB (intra-Eurosystem claims and liabilities) will cancel each other out and are therefore not shown. Furthermore, the financial statement excludes the assets and liabilities of the EU NCBs whose Member States are not participating in the euro area.
The purpose of the weekly financial statement of the Eurosystem is to provide a source of information especially on monetary policy operations and on changes in foreign reserves. The weekly financial statements will therefore be accompanied by an explanatory note providing information on the Eurosystem's monetary policy and foreign exchange operations with counterparties.
The data contained in the weekly financial statement refer to fixed reporting days (namely Fridays) and may therefore be distorted by random incidents. In addition, the weekly changes are to a considerable extent the result of typical recurrent fluctuations within a year and especially within a month. Therefore no immediate conclusions should be drawn from the weekly financial statement concerning medium or longer-term monetary tendencies. For such assessment, additional complementary statistics and analysis are necessary, which are published, for example, in the Monthly Bulletin of the ECB.
According to the opening financial statement of the Eurosystem on 1 January 1999, the most important single item on the asset side of the Eurosystem's balance sheet was external assets. The net position in foreign currency (asset items 2 and 3 minus liability items 6, 7 and 8) amounted to EUR 227.4 billion, whereby assets of EUR 237.0 billion were opposed to liabilities of EUR 9.6 billion. These figures refer to non-euro area currencies, since euro area currency denominated foreign exchange positions held on 31 December 1998 were transformed automatically into domestic positions through the transition to Stage Three (and are displayed, for example, under asset item 6). In addition, the stock of gold (asset item 1) of the Eurosystem amounted to EUR 99.6 billion.
The lending of the Eurosystem to financial sector counterparties of the euro area (asset item 5) includes, in the opening balance sheet, liquidity-providing monetary policy operations initiated by participating NCBs in Stage Two that continue into Stage Three. These operations will progressively mature within the following weeks and will then quickly be replaced by the Eurosystem's liquidity providing monetary policy operations. Even though the operations inherited from Stage Two did not correspond exactly to the types of operations foreseen for the Eurosystem, they were sufficiently similar in most cases to permit assignment to the individual sub-items of asset item 5 of the Eurosystem's balance sheet. Only the liquidity-providing operations which had no similarity with any of the Eurosystem's types of monetary policy operations were assigned to the asset item 5.7 (other lending).
The liquidity-providing monetary policy operations overlapping from Stage Two are included within asset item 5 and amount to EUR 185.1 billion. Operations similar to the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations (asset item 5.1) amounted to EUR 144.9 billion, being composed of operations conducted by Nationale Bank van België/Banque Nationale de Belgique (EUR 4.6 billion), the Banco d'España (EUR 23.1 billion), the Deutsche Bundesbank (EUR 83.1 billion), the Banque de France (EUR 19.8 billion), the Central Bank of Ireland (EUR 1.8 billion), the Banca d'Italia (EUR 2.1 billion), De Nederlandsche Bank (EUR 8.5 billion), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (EUR 0.7 billion) and Banco de Portugal (EUR 1.2 billion). Operations with similarities to longer-term operations (asset item 5.2) amounted to EUR 24.7 billion, all of which was contributed by the Deutsche Bundesbank (through its discount credit instrument). A volume of EUR 6.7 billion of fine-tuning reverse operations (asset item 5.3) was outstanding, composed of EUR 5.7 billion contributed by the Banque de France, EUR 0.4 billion contributed by the Central Bank of Ireland, and EUR 0.6 billion contributed by Suomen Pankki. Finally, lending facilities of NCBs which have a character similar to the Eurosystem's marginal lending facility were used by counterparties at end-1998 with a volume of EUR 6.4 billion. The small amount of credits related to marginal calls (asset item 5.6) of EUR 0.03 billion was contributed by the Banco d'España. Finally, a volume of EUR 2.4 billion was assigned to other lending (asset item 5.7). Partly related to previous monetary policy operations are also holdings of marketable securities issued by euro area residents and denominated in euro (asset item 6) which amounted to EUR 21.6 billion.
On the liabilities side the stock of banknotes in circulation (liability item 1) amounted to EUR 341.7 billion. This item is expected to decline in the following weeks reflecting the usual seasonal pattern. The following balance sheet items display relevant amounts of liquidity-absorbing monetary policy operations which overlap from Stage Two into Stage Three: use of deposit facilities (item 2.2, EUR 1.0 billion); fixed term deposits (item 2.3, EUR 1.9 billion); debt certificates issued (item 3, EUR 13.8 billion). The debt certificates stem from the Banco d'España (EUR 6.3 billion), the Banco de Portugal (EUR 6.7 billion) and Suomen Pankki (EUR 0.8 billion). While the latter amount will mature in the following days, the former two will mature gradually only in the course of the coming years.
The current account holdings of euro area financial sector counterparties with the Eurosystem (liability item 2.1), which amounted to EUR 84.4 billion at the start of Stage Three, consist almost entirely of holdings which related to the fulfilment of minimum reserves in 1998. These holdings will also contribute to the fulfilment by individual credit institutions of minimum reserves in the first maintenance period of Stage Three, which started on 1 January 1999 and will end on 23 February 1999. The Eurosystem's minimum reserve system includes averaging provisions, implying that credit institutions have to comply with the reserve requirement on average over this maintenance period. The exact reserve requirements in this first maintenance period are yet unknown to the Eurosystem. They will be calculated on the basis of the opening balance sheets of credit institutions as at 1 January 1999, data for which will only become available on a consolidated basis in early February 1999. At the present juncture, the Eurosystem estimates the reserve requirement in this maintenance period to be around EUR 100 billion. This estimate is based on November 1998 monetary data, taking into account seasonal factors.
Among the other balance sheet items general government debt (asset item 7) which reflects the outstanding remainder of lending to general government contracted before 1 January 1994, when Article 104 of the Treaty establishing the European Union introduced a ban on central bank lending to the public sector) amounted to EUR 60.1 billion and the liabilities to general government (liability item 4.1) to EUR 58.6 billion, resulting in a small net asset position towards governments of EUR 1.5 billion. Net liabilities to non-euro-area residents denominated in euro amounted to EUR 1.1 billion (asset item 4: EUR 8.9 billion; liability item 5: EUR 10.0 billion). The revaluation accounts amounted to EUR 59.9 billion and capital and reserves (liability item 11) to EUR 52.6 billion. Other assets of the Eurosystem (asset item 8) amounted to EUR 84.7 billion, and other liabilities (liability item 9) to EUR 60.7 billion.
The accompanying Annex provides general information on the structure, accounting conventions and content of the Eurosystem's consolidated weekly statements."
5 January 1999,"On 4 January the Eurosystem announced its first main refinancing operation, which was successfully completed today. The operation has a duration of 13 days, from 7 to 20 January 1999.
The main refinancing operation was conducted by means of reverse transactions at a fixed rate of 3%, which was pre-announced on 22 December 1998 by the ECB Governing Council. A total of 944 banks participated in the operation and submitted bids to the national central banks for an amount of EUR 482 billion. The total amount of liquidity allocated to the banking system amounted to EUR 75 billion, resulting in an allotment quota of 15.57%.
In arriving at the allotment decision, it was considered that credit institutions had accumulated a significant minimum reserve deficit in the first days of Stage Three. The decision to allot EUR 75 billion aims at providing sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions (on aggregate) to neutralise, relatively soon within the first maintenance period, this reserve deficit. In arriving at the allotment decision, it was also taken into account that a total of EUR 185.1 billion of liquidity-providing monetary policy operations conducted by the national central banks in Stage Two will mature in the first weeks of Stage Three. Of this amount, approximately EUR 75 billion will mature on 7 January 1999 (i.e. the settlement day of today's main refinancing operation). The allotment volume decided today also reflects the expected evolution of autonomous liquidity factors, such as the circulation of banknotes, which are anticipated to provide additional liquidity to the market.
The decision has been taken on the basis of an analysis of liquidity conditions in the whole euro area while paying due attention to the uncertainties connected to the phasing-in of the new system."
4 January 1999,"Today, Monday 4 January 1999, at 7 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T), the European System of Central Banks successfully began operating the TARGET system.
15 national real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and the ECB Payment Mechanism are now linked together in TARGET, which securely processes euro transactions in real time.
The system is available for banks and their customers and already hundreds of cross border payments have been processed.
Further information will be available on the ECB's Web Site (http://www.ecb.europa.eu) later today."
3 January 1999,"During the changeover weekend the ESCB has been monitoring the conduct of conversion activities at the ECB, at the participating national central banks (NCBs) and at certain private institutions which - in the view of the ESCB - represent the core of the financial infrastructure in the euro area.
Information has been exchanged on a regular basis through a network of communication points between the ECB and the NCBs. Regular contacts have also been maintained with other EU and non-EU central banks. Several NCBs have already published their assessment of the changeover process at national level.
In the monitoring of conversion activities conducted by the ESCB during the changeover weekend no incidents have been reported that may impair the smooth start of the system. The ESCB considers this to be a sign of the quality of the preparatory work conducted over recent months and years by the central banking community and by private financial market operators.
A last exchange of information before the opening of the markets will take place between the ad hoc communication points at the ECB and at the NCBs at 7 a.m. tomorrow, 4 January 1999. The ESCB will henceforth continue, as a part of its normal practice, to monitor closely developments in the markets."
31 December 1998,"In accordance with Article 109l (4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro were today adopted by the EU Council, upon a proposal from the Commission of the European Communities and after consultation of the European Central Bank (ECB) for effect at 0.00 on 1 January 1999 (local time). In compliance with the legal framework for the use of the euro, the irrevocable conversion rate for the euro for each participating currency is the only rate to be used for conversion either way between the euro and the national currency unit and also for conversions between national currency units.
The euro conversion rates are the following:"
31 December 1998,"Further to the decision taken today on the euro central rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma in ERM II, the European Central Bank, Danmarks Nationalbank and the Bank of Greece, in accordance with Article 1.2 of the European Central Bank Agreement of 1 September 1998 on an Exchange Rate Mechanism in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union, have established, by common accord, the compulsory intervention rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma in ERM II.
The euro central rates as well as the compulsory intervention points for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma are hereby made public."
31 December 1998,"The ECB publishes an updated list of assets eligible for use as collateral in ESCB credit operations on the Internet at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) every Friday (http://www.ecb.europa.eu, item MFIs and assets). However, in order to facilitate the process to redenominate securities before the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union, it has been necessary to delay the weekly process by which the list of eligible assets on the Internet is updated by two weeks and one day. The list on the Internet was last updated on Friday, 18 December 1998. The next updated list will be published on the Internet at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.) on Saturday, 2 January 1999.
Apart from the normal updating process, the new list will include the securities redenominated into euro from the respective national currency over the changeover weekend together with their new currency denomination.
Furthermore, it will list the new ISIN codes for securities in those cases where the ISIN codes have changed as a result of the currency redenomination.
Further information may be requested from the ECB, at the following address:"
22 December 1998,"On 1 January 1999 the ESCB will assume responsibility for defining and implementing the single monetary policy of the euro area. At today's meeting, the Governing Council of the ECB took a decision on the interest rates that will apply to the monetary policy instruments of the ESCB as from the start of Stage Three of EMU. These ECB interest rates will play a key role in signalling the monetary policy stance of the ESCB.
In this context, the Governing Council recalled that on 3 December 1998, in a co-ordinated decision, all the national central banks participating in the single monetary policy lowered their key central bank interest rates to 3% (with the exception of the Banca d'Italia, which reduced its discount rate to 3.5%). As explained by the ECB at that time, these decisions were based on a consensus reached in the ECB's Governing Council following a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area. The joint reduction in central interest rates had to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future.
Against this background, the Governing Council decided today to conduct the first main refinancing operation of the ESCB as a fixed rate tender and to set the level of the interest rate for this operation at 3%, in line with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two.
With respect to the interest rates on the ESCB's standing facilities, which are designed to form a corridor for movements in short-term money market rates, the Governing Council decided that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 4.5% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2%. These are the rates of the ESCB's standing facilities at the start of Stage Three, i.e. 1 January 1999.
However, as a transitory measure, between 4 January 1999 and 21 January 1999, the interest rate for the marginal lending facility will be set at a level of 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at a level of 2.75%. This measure aims at smoothing the adaptation of market participants to the integrated euro money market during the initial days of Monetary Union. The Governing Council intends to terminate this transitory measure following its meeting on 21 January 1999.
***
Further details of relevance for the submission of bids by counterparties to the first main refinancing operation will be announced on 4 January 1999. The allotment decision of the operation will be made public on 5 January 1999 and settlement will take place on 7 January 1999.
The first longer-term refinancing operation will be announced on 12 January 1999. The allotment decision of the operation will be made public on 13 January 1999 and settlement will take place on 14 January 1999. The Governing Council decided today that this operation will be conducted as a variable rate tender, using the single rate auction procedure.
In order to guide financial market participants to the new euro money market situation prevailing in Stage Three, some further technical information concerning the liquidity conditions expected at the start of Stage Three is annexed to this press release."
17 December 1998,"On 16 December 1998 TARGET completed its test programme. Testing with the 15 RTGS systems and the ECB payment mechanism (EPM) started in June 1997. TARGET will go live as planned at 7 a.m. (C.E.T.) on 4 January 1999.
TARGET testing was designed and conducted to ensure that the technical specifications were implemented correctly and to enable the TARGET service level - as published in July 1998 - to be met.
The European Central Bank and the national central banks would like to take this opportunity to thank the many hundreds of credit institutions which have participated in TARGET testing over the past months. Their active involvement and feedback have been a very positive factor in our preparation and fine-tuning. In particular, we should like to thank those who took part in the volume testing on 28 November 1998, when almost 100,000 test payments were processed during TARGET normal business hours.
The European Central Bank and the national central banks now look forward to providing the banking industry with an efficient and attractive payment system in euro from the start of Stage Three of EMU.
Further information is available from the ECB, at the following address:"
14 December 1998,"The Tables attached to this press release contain the first statistics produced by the European System of Central Banks relating to the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector (MFI sector) for the euro area and to the broad monetary aggregate M3 derived from this consolidated balance sheet. The data published today reflect the position as of 1 December 1998. Henceforth, these statistics will be updated (including for possible revisions to historical data) and published on a monthly basis. This press release covers the period September 1997-October 1998 for the month-end assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector and the month-end stock of M3 and its components. Furthermore, partly on the basis of estimates, 12-month growth rates of M3 are presented for the period December 1996-October 1998. Although the annual growth rates of M3 must be interpreted with some caution, as these data have a provisional nature, they represent the most reliable and comprehensive current source of monetary information for the euro area.
Consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector
The consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector (see Table 1, Annex) provides a complete and homogeneous coverage of those financial intermediaries that are considered to be money creating within the euro area. The principal aim is to provide the European Central Bank (ECB) with a comprehensive statistical picture of monetary and financial developments in the euro area and with the basis for the definition and presentation of the monetary aggregates and their counterparts.
The consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector is based therefore on the following two main elements:"
11 December 1998,"On 3 November 1998 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced some decisions concerning the arrangements for the monitoring, in co-operation with the national central banks and some central banks outside the European Union, of the ""changeover weekend"". The changeover weekend is the period between the announcement of the conversion rates of the euro vis-à-vis the national currencies of the participating Member States, early in the afternoon of 31 December 1998, and the opening of financial markets in euro early in the morning of 4 January 1999. A large part of the final conversion operations for the transition of the banking and financial system to the euro will be concentrated over these few days.
The ECB herewith continues to report on the latest developments of this work, conducted with the assistance of the Changeover Weekend Committee, that comprises experts from the ECB and the national central banks of the participating countries.
The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will monitor in particular the conversion of information technology systems, software, databases and other electronic records, especially inasmuch as they may have a bearing on the smooth launch of the single monetary policy.
The monitoring procedure is designed to detect at the earliest possible stage problems that may arise. If needed, the decision-making bodies of the ECB stand ready to take contingency measures.
The monitoring procedure will consist of two key components:"
8 December 1998,"The Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. José María Aznar, is to pay a visit to the European Central Bank on Thursday, 10 December 1998. He will be meeting Mr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, together with other members of the Executive Board, in order to exchange views on current issues and to hear about the preparations for the transition to Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1999."
4 December 1998,"At its meeting last Tuesday the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted the ""Regulation of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves"".
This Regulation lays down in a legally binding text the features of the minimum reserve system of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) presented in the ECB Report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998) and in the subsequent ECB press release entitled ""The use of a minimum reserve system by the European System of Central Banks in Stage Three: Final specification"" (13 October 1998).
The legal basis for the ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves is set out in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB and in the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2531/98 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the ECB, which was adopted by the ECOFIN on 23 November 1998 and published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 27 November 1998.
Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB entitles the ECB to require credit institutions established in euro area Member States to hold minimum reserves in pursuance of monetary policy objectives. In addition, the aforementioned Council Regulation specifies three aspects of the ESCB's minimum reserve system, namely the reserve base, the maximum permissible reserve ratios and the sanctions to be imposed in cases of non-compliance. All other features of this system may be decided upon by the ECB within the limits set by the Statute of the ESCB and the Council Regulation.
Against this background, the ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves adopted last Tuesday defines, inter alia, the applicable reserve ratios, the institutions subject to reserve requirements, the calculation of reserve requirements, and the remuneration of holdings of required reserves.
The ECB Regulation on the application of minimum reserves ensures that the terms and conditions of the ESCB's minimum reserve system are uniform throughout the euro area and completes the required legislation on this subject.
This Regulation will be available in all community languages from the national central banks and the ECB in the coming days and will shortly thereafter be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities."
4 December 1998,"At its meeting last Tuesday the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) adopted Regulation ECB/1998/16 of the European Central Bank concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the Monetary Financial Institutions sector, implementing Council Regulation (EC) No. 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank. Regulation ECB/1998/16 will enter into force on 1 January 1999, be binding in its entirety and directly applicable. It will impose statistical reporting obligations directly on reporting agents in the euro area.
The purpose of Regulation ECB/1998/16 is to enable the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) – which, in accordance with Article 5.2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), will carry out the work to the extent possible – to collect statistical information required for the fulfilment of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and, in particular, its task of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the European Community. The statistical information collected in accordance with Regulation ECB/1998/16 will be used to establish the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions (MFI) sector, the principal aim of which is to provide a comprehensive statistical picture of monetary developments covering the aggregated financial assets and liabilities of MFIs located in the participating Member States, which are viewed as one economic territory.
For these purposes, the ECB will need to receive comparable, reliable and up-to-date statistical information which is collected according to harmonised definitions and classifications throughout the euro area. Although the data will be collected in a decentralised manner by the NCBs, a sufficient degree of harmonisation and compliance with minimum reporting standards will be required in view of the need to establish a reliable statistical basis for the definition and conduct of the single monetary policy. Furthermore, with the aim of minimising the reporting burden involved, the statistical framework put into force under Regulation ECB/1998/16 will also be used to calculate the reserve basis in accordance with Regulation ECB/1998/15 on the application of minimum reserves.
It should be noted that a version that is almost identical to the present version of the Annexes of Regulation ECB/1998/16 was published for information in the General Documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures in September 1998. The most important aspects of Regulation ECB/1998/16 are summarised below."
3 December 1998,"All National Central Banks participating in the single monetary policy as from the start of Stage Three lower their key central bank rate today in a co-ordinated decision. These decisions reflect a thorough discussion in the ECB's Governing Council leading to a consensus on the basis of a common assessment of the economic, monetary and financial situation in the euro area.
The joint reduction in interest rates has to be seen as a de facto decision on the level of interest rates with which the ESCB will start Stage Three of Monetary Union and which it intends to maintain for the foreseeable future."
2 December 1998,"In April 1998 the European Monetary Institute (EMI) published the ""Money and Banking Statistics Compilation Guide - Guidance provided to the NCBs for the compilation of money and banking statistics for submission to the ECB"" (Compilation Guide) to assist national central banks (NCBs) in the compilation of the statistical information that they have to submit to the European Central Bank (ECB) in accordance with the statistical requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union, as set out in full in the report entitled ""The statistical requirements for Monetary Union"" (Implementation Package), July 1996. Moreover, on 1 September 1998, the ECB formally approved the Compilation Guide.
The April 1998 edition of the Compilation Guide stated that it would be updated periodically. The need for the first such an update has now arisen on two accounts.
First, the guidance currently contained in the Compilation Guide regarding the money market paper item in the MFI balance sheet statistics needs to be enhanced in order to ensure sufficient homogeneity, especially in terms of cross-border classification across the euro area and taking into account that this item is included in the reserve base of the minimum reserve system of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) (see the press release of the ECB dated 8 July 1998).
Second, while the Compilation Guide refers to a Stage Three environment, a ""Stage Two classification issue"" has arisen in some Member States, with regard to bill-based lending. In view of the possible importance for the historical series, this update of the Compilation Guide is also warranted in this respect.
The Compilation Guide will be distributed by each of the EU national central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. Copies are also available from the ECB at the following address:"
1 December 1998,"On 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB announced the main elements of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council announced its quantitative definition of the ESCB's primary objective, namely price stability. Price stability was defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%. Furthermore, the Governing Council outlined the two main elements of the strategy that it will use to achieve the objective of maintaining price stability. First, a prominent role will be assigned to money. This role will be signalled by the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate. Second, in parallel with the analysis of developments in the monetary data in relation to the reference value, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to price stability in the euro area will be undertaken. This assessment will encompass a wide range of economic and financial indicator variables. The announcement on 13 October left two issues unresolved, namely the derivation of the reference value for monetary growth and the definition of the specific broad monetary aggregate for which the reference value will be announced. At its meeting on 1 December 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on these remaining issues regarding the ESCB's monetary policy strategy by specifying the details of the quantitative reference value for monetary growth."
1 December 1998,"Further to the publication by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998), the ECB will publish, before the start of Stage Three, a brochure covering the main features of the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) on the Internet at http://www.ecb.europa.eu. Further details of the procedures to be applied for the cross-border use of collateral can be obtained from the national central banks.
Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB requires all liquidity providing operations of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) to be based on adequate collateral. Moreover, one of the guiding principles of Monetary Union is that counterparties should be treated equally. In seeking to apply these principles to the use of collateral, the ESCB has examined ways of ensuring that all collateral eligible for use either in monetary policy operations or to obtain intraday liquidity in TARGET is available to all market participants, regardless of where in the European Union the collateral or the participant is situated, subject to the limitations on the cross-border use of collateral indicated in the General documentation.
The work of the ESCB has clearly shown that, in the medium to long term, the market operators are developing adequate solutions for the cross-border settlement of collateral. However, in the short to medium term, there is a need for a system offering cross-border settlement which covers the entire EU and is operational from the start of Stage Three.
The ESCB has therefore designed the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) as an interim solution, in order to facilitate the cross-border use of collateral until adequate alternative market solutions are available throughout the Member States of the European Union. The CCBM will enable counterparties to use both tier one and tier two assets on a cross-border basis. The ECB has now completed testing of the procedures and finalised the legal documentation governing the relationships between the central banks.
A list of the collateral eligible for the ESCB's monetary policy operations is available on the ECB Web site. In addition, central banks of EU Member States which are not participating in the euro area from the start of Stage Three are preparing lists of the collateral against which they will extend intraday credit through TARGET. These lists can be obtained directly from the respective national central banks.
In addition to its availability on the Internet, the brochure will be distributed by each of the EU national central banks to interested parties in their respective countries. Copies will also be available from the ECB at the following address:"
1 December 1998,"Following the notification issued by the Commission of the European Communities of revised GDP statistical data, it was decided to adjust the shares of the national central banks in the key for the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) to the following percentage rates:"
12 November 1998,"Today the European Central Bank (ECB) published a report entitled ""Third progress report on the TARGET project"" (pdf 174 kB).
The objective of the Report is to provide information concerning the progress made on the TARGET project since September 1997, the date on which the previous TARGET progress report was published. The Report covers policy aspects of TARGET as well as organisational and business aspects. It also describes the progress made on the technical implementation of the system and provides a brief overview of the legal framework for TARGET.
The Report outlines the access criteria for RTGS systems linked to TARGET, which have now been specified in detail, and states that remote access to settlement account facilities in TARGET will be permitted for institutions within the European Economic Area. However, it is not expected that extensive use will be made of the latter possibility.
The Report also sets out the detailed regime for the granting of intraday credit, with different provisions for: (1) ESCB monetary policy counterparts; (2) credit institutions participating in euro RTGS systems in EU countries outside the euro area; and (3) RTGS participants which are not credit institutions. Remote participants will not have access to intraday or overnight credit from the host central bank.
The Report notes that TARGET will play an important role in intraday liquidity management in euro. It will allow liquidity in euro to be moved very quickly between all EU countries. Today, credit institutions are used to dealing with domestic counterparts in the money market, but in Stage Three liquidity adjustments will take place partly on a cross-border basis. In this context, the ESCB expects that credit institutions will concentrate their core liquidity - and therefore their very high value payments, in particular money market payments - in TARGET. This will be in the business interest of credit institutions and will contribute to the ESCB objective of ensuring the singleness of the euro money market.
Further aspects which are addressed in the Report include the price structure for cross-border TARGET payments, bank-to-bank charges for customer payments in TARGET, the transmission of euro-related information during the changeover period, the handling of return payments and central bank correspondent banking relations.
With regard to the technical implementation of the TARGET project, the Report highlights that on 1 July 1998, as scheduled, all the national central banks (NCBs) and the ECB moved to the penultimate test phase known as simulation testing. The aim of the simulation phase is to test operations in an environment which is as close as possible to the production environment, integrating operational staff and operational infrastructures. Credit institutions have been invited to participate in end-to-end simulation testing on specified dates. The final test period will comprise migration to production tests and will take place in November and December 1998.
The Report describes the legal framework for TARGET, which will be based on: (1) a Guideline of the European Central Bank on TARGET, which will apply to euro area NCBs and the ECB; and (2) a TARGET Agreement, to be entered into by the ECB and the NCBs, which will govern relations between euro area NCBs and the ECB, on the one hand, and non-euro area NCBs and the ECB, on the other, as well as relations among non-euro area NCBs. For participants in a national RTGS system linked to TARGET, the applicable rules will continue to be the national RTGS rules applying to such systems, as amended to reflect the provisions of the Guideline and the Agreement. The Report also announces that the ECB and the NCBs are preparing an information guide for credit institutions using TARGET, which will be published in December 1998. This document is designed to assist credit institutions using TARGET in making the best use of the system.
The Report will be distributed by each of the EU National Central Banks to interested parties in their respective countries. It can be accessed via the ECB's Web site (http://www.ecb.europa.eu). Copies are also available from the ECB at the following address:"
3 November 1998,"The euro will become the currency of the participating Member States as from 1 January 1999 and the national currency units will be sub-units of the euro. The euro banknotes and coins will not be available until 1 January 2002. To ensure substitutability between the national currency units, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided that each participating national central bank shall arrange for it to be possible, at one location at least, to exchange legal tender banknotes of other participating Member States against national banknotes and coins at the official conversion rate.
The national central banks may limit the number and/or the total value of banknotes they are prepared to accept for any given transaction or on any one day. The national central banks may also approve the submission of banknotes of other participating Member States from commercial banks and bureaux de change to be repatriated to the issuing central bank.
The preparations being made by the national central banks concerning exchange and repatriation will be finalised before the beginning of December 1998.
Further information may be requested from the ECB, at the address below.
[Note: Further information is now available at the new section: The exchange of national banknotes in the euro area.]"
3 November 1998,"As is the case with every central bank, the ECB has a direct interest in the prudent design and management of any payment and settlement system processing its own currency, the euro. Indeed, the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems is a crucial aspect of a sound currency and essential to the conduct of monetary policy. These systems also have a significant bearing on the functioning of financial markets. Changes in payment systems may cause unpredictable shifts in the demand for, or supply of, base money. Moreover, safe and efficient payment systems are critical to the maintenance of banking and financial stability.
Against this background, and in accordance with guidelines approved by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries, the Governing Council of the ECB wishes to underline that, as in any other monetary system, central bank money in euro can only be provided by the central banks that belong to the euro area. Also, the Governing Council of the ECB invites all central banks outside the euro area to contact the ECB whenever they became aware of a planned settlement arrangement in euro, be it domestic, cross-border or multi-currency in nature.
In the context of TARGET, the ECB decided in July 1998 to accept the fact that non-euro area EU national central banks will be able to offer limited intraday liquidity in euro to their participants. It is an innovative arrangement, intended to smooth the future transition of the relevant Member States to Economic and Monetary Union. This arrangement, which is subject to the binding conditions set out in an agreement with the central banks concerned, should be seen as a very specific exception to the rule that no central bank shall grant credit in a currency other than its own.
Further information may be requested from the ECB, at the following address:"
3 November 1998,"The Governing Council today concluded its discussions concerning the preparations for the so-called ""changeover weekend"", the period of time between the publication of the proposal by the European Commission of the irrevocable conversion rates for the euro, on the afternoon of 31 December 1998, and the opening of the financial markets, on the morning of 4 January 1999.
During this period of three and a half days, those public and private institutions which will subsequently commence operating in euro in the financial markets will be confronted with the complex task of modifying a very large number of electronic records under very severe time constraints, before markets in euro open for trading on 4 January 1999. Managing the logistics of this will require a great effort on the part of the banking and financial industry, including the ECB and the NCBs.
In the ECB and the NCBs the final migration of the electronic systems will take up a sizeable proportion of staff resources and many staff members will be working during that weekend, while the members of the decision-making bodies will be on hand to take any measures considered necessary. Reducing the technical risks of the final migration to the euro forms part of the ECB's duties. The ESCB started its preparations for the changeover weekend a long time ago. The ECB and the NCBs will be in a position to deliver their entire complex infrastructure to the markets by the morning of 4 January 1999.
The Governing Council has set up a ""Changeover Weekend Committee"" which will organise the monitoring of developments vis-à-vis the final migration to the euro within the ECB and the NCBs and in the banking and financial industry, both prior to and during the changeover weekend.
The ECB expects the banking and financial community in the euro area to be fully aware of the logistical challenge that the changeover weekend represents and that careful preparation is required. Reference could be made to the adaptation of large-value payment systems, the impact of the redenomination of securities on securities settlement systems and the conversion of databases of providers of financial information. The ECB is conscious of the concerns of some market practitioners and is therefore preparing to work together with other public authorities to orchestrate the necessary policy responses to any unexpected events which may occur in the banking and financial industry during the changeover weekend.

23 October 1998,"Further to the publication of the European Central Bank (ECB) entitled “ The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures” (the “ General Documentation”) (September 1998), the ECB will publish on Monday, 26 October 1998 at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.), on the Internet a list of assets eligible for use as collateral in ESCB credit operations (http://www.ecb.europa.eu, item MFIs and assets). For the time being, this service will be accessible from the ECB website on working days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.).
Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB requires all ESCB liquidity-providing operations to be based on adequate collateral. With the aim of protecting the ESCB from incurring losses in its monetary policy operations or in the provision of intraday credit in TARGET, ensuring the equal treatment of counterparties and enhancing operational efficiency, underlying assets have to fulfil certain criteria in order to be eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations. These eligibility criteria are laid down in Chapter 6 of the General Documentation. The list of eligible assets shows the underlying assets that are deemed by the ECB to fulfil these eligibility criteria.
It is recognised that the harmonisation of eligibility criteria throughout the euro area would contribute to ensuring equal treatment and operational efficiency. At the same time, due attention has to be paid to existing differences in financial structures across the Member States. A distinction is therefore made, essentially for purposes internal to the ESCB, between two categories of assets eligible for ESCB monetary policy operations. These two categories are referred to as “ tier one” and “ tier two” respectively, where:"
16 October 1998,"Further to the publication of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) entitled ""Statistical requirements for Stage Three of Monetary Union (Implementation Package)"" (July 1996) and the publication of the European Central Bank (ECB) entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998), the ECB will publish on Tuesday, 20 October 1998 at 8 a.m. ECB time (C.E.T.), on the Internet a list of monetary financial institutions (MFIs) for statistical purposes and institutions subject to minimum reserves (http://www.ecb.europa.eu, item MFIs and assets). For the time being, this service will be accessible from the ECB website on working days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. ECB time (C.E.T.).
The list of MFIs for statistical purposes will facilitate the production of a comprehensive and consistent balance sheet of the money-creating sector in the euro area and serve other important purposes, such as the European System of Accounts (ESA 95, November 1996). In addition to the national central banks and the ECB, the list includes all credit institutions (as defined in Community law), money market funds and other institutions fulfilling the MFI definition.
The list of institutions subject to minimum reserves is based on Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, which entitles the ECB to require credit institutions established in the euro area to hold minimum reserves in pursuance of monetary policy objectives. This implies that branches in the euro area of entities with no registered office in the euro area are also subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system. No credit institution established in the euro area will be exempt from its obligations under the ESCB's minimum reserve system as from the start of Stage Three. It should be emphasised that only institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system may be eligible to be counterparties to the ESCB's monetary policy operations.
Credit institutions are entitled to deduct liabilities held vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system from the reserve base to be applied for the calculation of the institution's reserve requirement. The publication of the list of institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system will therefore allow credit institutions to determine the amount of liabilities held vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system.
The list on the Internet of MFIs for statistical purposes and institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system will be updated on a monthly basis. The updates will be made available to the public on the last business day of each calendar month and will be valid for the calculation of the reserve base of credit institutions for the subsequent maintenance period. Procedures for monitoring and continuous checking have been put in place to ensure that the list remains up to date, accurate and consistent.
At the request of reporting agents or the institutions subject to the ESCB's minimum reserve system, it will be possible to obtain a hard copy of the list from the national central banks.

13 October 1998,1. At its meeting on 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB agreed on the main elements of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ESCB. These elements concern:
13 October 1998,"On 8 July 1998 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the main features of the minimum reserve system to be used by the European System of Central Banks (ESCB). The main features included the range of institutions subject to reserve requirements, the liabilities included in the reserve base, the potential range of the reserve ratio, the introduction of a lump-sum allowance, and the remuneration of reserve holdings. Further details of the minimum reserve system were presented in the recently published ECB report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"" (September 1998).
At its meeting on 13 October 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB discussed the final specifications of some of the remaining open issues regarding the minimum reserve system. The following decisions were taken:"
13 October 1998,"13 BILLION EURO BANKNOTES WILL BE PRINTED
By 1 January 2002 (launch date) 13 billion euro banknotes will have been printed in the eleven participating Member States. This estimate, which is broken down into estimates for each country, will be updated annually. National central banks will now launch their printing orders on the basis of this estimate. Mass production of the euro banknotes will start in the first quarter of 1999.
AN ANALYSIS CENTRE FOR CURRENCY COUNTERFEITS WILL BE ESTABLISHED
The ECB will establish an analysis centre for counterfeits which will investigate counterfeit euro banknotes. The relevant statistical and technical data will be stored in a database which will also be designed to include similar data on counterfeit euro coins. The contents of the database will be made available to all of the national central banks of the EU countries and to the respective law enforcement bodies involved in combating counterfeiting."
29 September 1998,"As a part of the preparatory work for Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) will today release a Report, entitled ""Assessment of EU Securities Settlement Systems against the standards for their use in ESCB credit operations"". The Report is the follow-up to the EMI report published in January 1998, and entitled ""Standards for the use of EU Securities Settlement Systems in ESCB credit operations"".
The ECB and the EU national central banks have assessed twenty-nine EU securities settlement systems against the standards laid down in the above mentioned report. The objective is to ensure that European System of Central Banks (ESCB) credit operations are processed through securities settlement systems which will: (i) prevent the national central banks from bearing inappropriate risks when conducting monetary policy operations and in providing intraday credit to TARGET participants; and (ii) ensure the same level of safety for all national central banks' operations settled in different ways throughout the European Union. In particular, the new Report contains a list of those eligible securities settlement systems, which qualify for involvement in ESCB monetary policy and intraday credit operations. A separate assessment concerning links between securities settlement systems is currently under way.
The results of the assessment of the twenty-nine securities settlement systems show that all of them can be considered to be eligible for use in ESCB credit operations. However, most of the securities settlement systems are eligible on a particular basis.
More specifically, from an operational point of view:"
18 September 1998,"The European Central Bank (ECB) will today publish a Report entitled ""The single monetary policy in Stage Three: General documentation on ESCB monetary policy instruments and procedures"". The Report contains a detailed description of the monetary policy instruments and procedures to be applied by the ESCB in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union. Hence it provides credit institutions with the information they will need in order to prepare for participation in ESCB monetary policy operations as from 1 January 1999. The Report expands upon and updates the material contained in an earlier version published by the European Monetary Institute (EMI) on 23 September 1997.
The Report first sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by credit institutions in order to be eligible as counterparties to ESCB monetary policy operations. It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB (the main refinancing operations, the longer-term refinancing operations, fine-tuning operations and structural operations) and the ESCB's two standing facilities (the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility). The Report contains a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations. Furthermore, the Report specifies the eligibility criteria and the risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB's liquidity-providing operations. Moreover, the Report describes the features of the ESCB's minimum reserve system. Finally, the Report presents specific provisions to be applied for the ESCB's monetary policy instruments and procedures in the transition to Stage Three.
With reference to the EMI publication of September 1997, the present Report specifies additional details, particularly in the following areas:"
18 September 1998,"The Headquarters Agreement between the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the European Central Bank concerning the seat of the European Central Bank was signed today by Dr. Klaus Kinkel, German Foreign Minister, and Dr. Theo Waigel, German Finance Minister, on behalf of the German Government and by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), on behalf of the ECB.
The Agreement includes provisions for the application of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities. In particular it governs technical aspects relating to the status of the ECB and of its staff on German territory and the relationship between the ECB and the German authorities.
The Agreement will now be sent to the competent authorities for ratification. The Government of the Federal Republic of Germany and the ECB expect that the legislative process will have been concluded by the end of 1998 and that it will be possible for the Agreement to come into force in time for the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union."
12 September 1998,"In accordance with the Resolution adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997, the European Monetary System (EMS) will, from the start of Stage Three of EMU, be replaced by a new exchange rate mechanism that will link the currencies of non-euro area Member States to the euro. The exchange rate mechanism will help to ensure that non-euro area Member States participating in the mechanism orient their policies towards stability, foster convergence and thereby help them in their efforts to adopt the euro. Participation in the exchange rate mechanism will be voluntary for all non-euro area Member States. A Member State which does not participate in the exchange rate mechanism from the outset may participate at a later date. The operating procedures for the new exchange rate mechanism have been laid down in an agreement between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the non-euro area national central banks.
For the currency of each Member State participating in the mechanism, a central rate against the euro and a standard fluctuation band of ±15% will be defined, in principle supported by automatic unlimited intervention at the margins, with very short-term financing available. However, the ECB and the participating non-euro area national central banks could suspend automatic intervention if this were to conflict with their primary objective of maintaining price stability. In line with the Resolution of the European Council, exchange rate policy co-operation may be further strengthened, for example by allowing closer exchange rate links between the euro and other currencies in the exchange rate mechanism, where, and to the extent that, these are appropriate in the light of progress towards convergence.
Since the adoption of the Resolution by the European Council at its meeting in Amsterdam in June 1997, some operating features have been laid down in annexes to the above-mentioned agreement:"
12 September 1998,"Given that the euro banknotes will be put into circulation on 1 January 2002, there are less than 800 working days to go before their launch. The technical preparations for the euro banknotes are proceeding according to schedule. The origination (i.e. the process of converting the designs into banknotes) has now been successfully completed. A zero-production run will be conducted in the autumn before mass production starts in early 1999.
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank today decided that there will be no national feature on the euro banknotes. It also confirmed (in line with previous recommendations made by the European Monetary Institute) that the following seven banknote denominations will be issued: EUR 5, EUR 10, EUR 20, EUR 50, EUR 100, EUR 200 and EUR 500.
Folders featuring the draft euro banknote designs can be obtained from the ECB at the following address:"
12 September 1998,"In addition to its meetings scheduled for 13 October, 3 November and 1 December 1998, the Governing Council has agreed to hold a further meeting on 22 December 1998. The purpose of the meeting on 22 December 1998 will be to tidy up the remaining preparatory work. It is to be recalled that monetary policy decisions remain the responsibility of the national authorities until the end of 1998.
The Governing Council has also agreed that in the first year of Stage Three (i.e. 1999) its meetings shall, as a rule, be scheduled to be held on Thursdays every other week, starting on 7 January 1999. Exceptions to this rule are envisaged to accommodate special holiday periods, namely Easter, Corpus Christi, the summer holiday period and New Year. As a result, the schedule for the meetings of the Governing Council is as follows:
